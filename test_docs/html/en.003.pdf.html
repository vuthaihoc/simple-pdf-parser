<p><b>INTRODUCTION</b>
</p>
<p>Liver cirrhosis is the most advanced stage of chronic
liver disease. It is characterized histologically by the pres-
ence of regenerative nodules. Its prevalence is estimated at
0.27% in the United States,1<sub> and it is associated with mul-</sub>
</p>
<p>tiple etiologies, most commonly ethanol consumption,
chronic viral hepatitis B and C and diabetes mellitus.1,2
</p>
<p>In-hospital mortality for disease decompensation is 9.1%
in South Korea3<sub> and is 25.0% after 30 days of admission in</sub>
</p>
<p>Brazil.4<sub> Identifying patients with worse prognosis would</sub>
</p>
<p>facilitate early management of potentially severe cases.
</p>
<p>Several prognostic markers have been studied to identify
mortality associated with decompensated cirrhosis, in-
cluding the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD)
score and its derivatives, Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure
(ACLF) score, Interleukins 2, 6 and 8 (IL-2, IL-6 and IL-
8, respectively), C-reactive protein (CRP) and even total
leukocyte count.
</p>
<p>Pentraxins are proteins formed by 5 monomers that
form a ring in radial symmetry. They are a class of pattern
recognition receptors. Among pentraxins, the main ones
are pentraxin-3, CRP and serum amyloid P component.
PTX3 is a long-chain pentraxin considered an acute phase

</p>
<p>The aim of this study is to describe PTX3 levels in am-
bulatory patients and hospitalized patients with liver cir-
rhosis and their association with disease prognosis.
</p>
<p><b>MATERIAL AND METHODS</b>
</p>
<p><b>Sample</b>
</p>
<p>This is a prospective cohort study with consecutive in-
clusion of patients with liver cirrhosis treated at the hepa-
tology ambulatory department and admitted to the
emergency service of a tertiary hospital in southern Brazil
between January 2011 and January 2014 because of disease
decompensation. Patients were excluded from the study
because of insufficient clinical and laboratory data in the
medical records, hepatocellular carcinoma that did not
meet Milan criteria and refusal to participate in the study.
</p>
<p>During routine outpatient or emergency admission,
subjects were asked to participate and sign the free and in-
formed consent form. A family member or guardian
would authorize data collection if the patient had encepha-
lopathy grades III or IV. Clinical and laboratory variables
were collected from interviews and from the medical
records. The following clinical variables were studied:
age, sex, skin color, etiology of cirrhosis and presence of
ascites. Laboratory variables collected on admission in-
cluded serum creatinine, MELD, Child-Pugh and Chron-
ic Liver Failure - Sequential Organ Failure Assessment
(CLIF-SOFA) scores, total leukocyte count, serum sodi-
um, platelet count, international normalized ratio (INR),
albumin, CRP and total bilirubin.
</p>
<p>The diagnosis of cirrhosis was established either histo-
logically when liver biopsy was available or by a combina-
tion of clinical, imaging and laboratory data in patients
with evidence of portal hypertension.
</p>
<p>PTX3 assays were performed by Enzyme-Linked Im-
munosorbent Assay with serum samples collected on ad-
mission or at an outpatient visit and stored in a freezer at
-80°C (ELISA; R&amp;D Systems - Minneapolis, MN).
</p>
<p><b>M e t h o d s</b>
</p>
<p>Patients were followed during hospitalization and 90-
day mortality was assessed by telephone in case of dis-
charge. The 90-day mortality rates did not include patients
who underwent liver transplantation (because they were
excluded from the study).
</p>
<p>Individuals with suspected bacterial infection at ad-
mission underwent clinical examination to confirm the
diagnosis and establish the primary source of infection.
The diagnosis of infection was performed according to
the criteria of the Center for Disease Control.11<sub> Diag-</sub>
</p>
<p>nostic paracentesis was performed for all patients with
ascites present at admission. Hepatic encephalopathy
was graded according to the criteria of West-Haven.12
</p>
<p>If present, the precipitating factor was investigated and
lactulose was administered with dose adjustment as
needed.
</p>
<p>The severity of liver disease was estimated by Child-
Pugh13<sub> and MELD scores</sub>14<sub> calculated based on laboratory</sub>
</p>
<p>tests performed on admission. ACLF and CLIF-SOFA
were defined as proposed by the European Association for
the Study of the Liver-Chronic Liver Failure (EASL-
CLIF).15
</p>
<p><b>Statistical analysis</b>
</p>
<p>Numerical variables with normal distribution were ex-
pressed as the mean and standard deviation (SD) and were
compared using Student’s t test. Numerical variables with
non-normal distribution were expressed as medians and
compared using the Mann-Whitney test. The normality of
variable distribution was determined by the Kolmorogov-
Smirnov test. Qualitative variables were represented by fre-
quency (%) and chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test were
used when needed for analysis. Bivariate analyses were per-
formed to compare cirrhotic individuals from outpatient
visits with hospitalized patients. Bivariate analysis was per-
formed to compare the mean levels of PTX3 in terms of the
presence of cirrhosis complications at time of admission.
Spearman correlation analysis was performed to compare
the values of serum PTX3 to the laboratory variables and
prognostic markers MELD, Child-Pugh and CLIF-SOFA.
A cutoff point for the PTX3 was determined by Receiver
Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. Survival probabili-
ty was calculated using Kaplan-Meier method and differ-
ences in survival between groups were compared using the
log-rank test.

<p>The study protocol was in accordance with the ethical
principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and was ap-
proved by the local research ethics committee under the

</p>
<p><b>RESULTS</b>
</p>
<p><b>Casuistry analysis</b>
</p>
<p>Between January 2011 and January 2014, studied patients
included 32 healthy controls, 29 subjects with liver cirrho-
sis treated at the hepatology ambulatory department and
130 cirrhotic patients admitted to the hospital for disease
decompensation. Table 1 shows the demographic and epi-
demiological characteristics of patients included in the
study. The mean age of the controls was 41.8 ± 15.4 years
and 78.0% were male. Individuals with cirrhosis had a
mean age of 54.1 ± 11.7 years, 73.8% were male, 35.6%
were Child-Pugh class C and the mean MELD score was
15.0 ± 6.2. Only seven patients underwent needle biopsy
of the liver to diagnose cirrhosis. The etiology of cirrhosis
was related to alcohol in 35.0%, alcohol and hepatitis C vi-
rus (HCV) in 22.5% and HCV only in 16.9%.
</p>
<p><b>Comparative analysis of</b>
<b>outpatient and hospitalized patients</b>
</p>
<p><b>with liver cirrhosis</b>
</p>
<p>Outpatients and hospitalized patients with liver cirrho-
sis had similar clinical characteristics except for skin
</p>
<p>color, in which there was a higher proportion of individu-
als with white skin color among outpatients (50.0% vs.
71.3%; p = 0.025). These characteristics are shown in table 1.
When comparing PTX3 levels between groups, it was
observed that the cirrhotic outpatients had higher
means compared to healthy controls (2.6 vs. 1.1 ng/mL;
p &lt; 0.001). Hospitalized cirrhotic patients had higher
means compared both to healthy controls (3.8 vs. 1.1
ng/mL; p &lt; 0.001) and to cirrhotic outpatients (3.8 vs. 2.6 ng/mL;
p &lt; 0.001) as can be seen in figure 1.
</p>
<p><b>Correlation analysis of</b>
<b>PTX3 with variables of interest</b>
</p>
<p>There was a positive correlation between serum levels
of PTX3 and creatinine (r = 0.220; p = 0.012), MELD
(r = 0.279; p = 0.001), Child-Pugh score (r = 0.224;
p = 0.010) and CLIF-SOFA score (r = 0.225; p = 0.010).
There was no correlation between PTX3 levels and total
leukocyte count, serum sodium, platelet count, INR, al-
bumin, CRP and total bilirubin.
</p>
<p><b>Comparative analysis of</b>
<b>serum PTX3 levels according to</b>
</p>
<p><b>complications on admission</b>
</p>
<p>When comparing PTX3 levels in terms of the presence
or absence of ACLF (Figure 2), it was observed that pa-
tients with ACLF showed higher PTX3 medians than
those without ACLF (8.0 vs. 3.1 ng/mL; p &lt; 0.001). When
comparing PTX3 levels according to MELD score (Fig-
ure 3), it was observed that patients with MELD higher
than 20 had higher median PTX3 levels compared to oth-
ers (6.7 vs. 3.4 ng/mL; p = 0.002).

sification, it was observed that individuals in Child class C
had similar levels of PTX3 to the others (3.9 vs. 3.6 ng/mL;

thy (4.2 vs. 3.0 ng/mL; p = 0.247).
</p>
<p>It was observed that the number of organ failures was
associated with higher mean serum levels of PTX3 (Fig-
ure 4) as follows: none = 3.2 ng/mL; one = 4.7 ng/mL;
two or more failures = 8.0 ng/mL (p = 0.006).

<p><b>Survival analysis according to</b>

</p>
<p>Forty patients died within 90 days (30.8%). It was ob-
served that patients who died within 90 days had higher se-
</p>
<p>rum levels of PTX3 on admission compared to those who
survived (5.3 vs. 3.4 ng/mL; p = 0.009). Figure 5 shows the
Kaplan-Meier curves associated with serum PTX3 levels.
The probability of survival of patients with serum levels of
PTX3 higher than or equal to 5.4 ng/mL was 54.0%, while
those with serum levels lower than 5.4 ng/mL showed a
90-day survival rate of higher than 77.0% (p = 0.002).
</p>
<p><b>DISCUSSION</b>
</p>
<p>This study has identified unprecedentedly higher PTX3
levels in cirrhotic outpatients compared to healthy con-
trols as well as higher levels in cirrhotic patients hospital-
ized for disease decompensation compared to cirrhotic
outpatients. The higher PTX3 levels in patients with acute
decompensation in comparison to cirrhotic outpatients
and healthy controls is consistent with the results of stud-
ies that showed elevated PTX3 levels in diseases with an

<p>Serum levels are positively correlated with disease severity.
This finding is corroborated by the positive correlation
between serum PTX3 levels and the scores associated with
severity of liver cirrhosis (MELD, Child-Pugh and CLIF-

matory response syndrome (SIRS), sepsis, severe sepsis

</p>
<p>was observed that PTX3 was the first plasma protein to
rise, with a peak at approximately 7.5 h in patients with
SIRS or infections in the clinical spectrum of sepsis.
Levels declined in patients with ARDS after 24 h of intu-
bation.18<sub> CRP, a commonly used inflammation marker,</sub>

remained elevated longer.18 <sub>Mauri, et al. performed a pre-</sub>
</p>
<p>liminary retrospective study if patients with ARDS that
also showed a positive correlation between PTX3 levels
and the number of organ failures,20<sub> consistent with the</sub>
</p>
<p>results of this study.
</p>
<p>In this study a positive correlation was also observed
between serum PTX3 levels and 90-day mortality, consist-
ent with the results of other groups that evaluated mortali-
ty in patients with chronic kidney disease, acute
myocardial infarction and ARDS. In these studies, PTX3
</p>
<p>proved to be an important and early predictor of mortali-
ty.17,18<sub> In patients with SIRS, sepsis, severe sepsis or septic</sub>
</p>
<p>shock, both PTX3 and IL-6 showed significant positive
correlations with mortality.19<sub> IL-6 was not assessed in this</sub>
</p>
<p>study. However, our group showed that IL-6 levels were
positively associated with 90-day mortality (OR 1.002; 95%
CI 1.000 - 1.004; p = 0.029).21
</p>
<p>Many studies have compared the efficacy of PTX3 to
CRP as a predictor of severity and mortality, given the
widespread use of CRP for this purpose. The results as
mentioned above show positive correlation when serum
levels are compared without time reference. However, no
correlation was apparent when considering the time to
peak of each of these markers. In liver cirrhosis, however,
CRP production is affected because it is synthesized al-
most entirely in the liver. This may compromise its utility
as an inflammation biomarker in these patients.22,23<sub> This</sub>
</p>
<p>might explain the absence of correlation between CRP and
PTX3 in this study. However, Bota, et al. have not found
statistically significant differences in CRP levels between
intensive care patients with or without liver cirrhosis.24
</p>
<p>Lazzarotto, et al. demonstrated that CRP levels are sensi-
tive for diagnosis of infection and as predictors of 90-day
mortality in patients with cirrhosis.25<sub> Importantly, there</sub>
</p>
<p>is, to a lesser extent, production of CRP in inflamed tis-
sues.26,27<sub> This synthesis may be responsible for incomplete</sub>
</p>
<p>suppression of CRP levels even in patients with severe he-
patic impairment.
</p>
<p>There was also a positive correlation between serum
levels of PTX3 and creatinine. Due to its high molecular
weight (40.6 KD) and multimeric structure, PTX3 levels
appear to increase as the glomerular filtration rate (GFR)
decreases secondary to reduced clearance.17<sub> The same</sub>

a marker of renal function. Numerous pathological condi-
tions that lead to reduced GFR -such as sepsis, which gen-
erates numerous shunts in circulation and redistribution
of blood volume; major bleeding, by an absolute reduc-
tion in blood volume; ascites, by third space volume re-
tention and reduction of effective circulating volume-
tend to increase serum creatinine. The complications of
cirrhosis involve the above hemodynamic dysfunctions.
One could imagine that this would be the reason for the
positive correlation between serum levels of PTX3 and
creatinine. However, more hemodynamic studies are
needed to confirm this hypothesis.

<p>Although recently published studies present PTX3 as a
marker of severity and/or mortality, little is known about
its role in vivo in humans. Garlanda, et al. demonstrated in
mice deficient in PTX3 that it has many functions includ-
ing regulation of innate immunity against various micro-
organisms, discrimination of self- from non-self
molecular patterns and tissue repair.27<sub> Other studies</sub>
</p>
<p>showed that the initial function of PTX3 is protective.28<sub> It</sub>
</p>
<p>participates in the recognition of harmful stimuli, migra-
tion of neutrophils to sites of infection and promotion of
phagocytosis of bacteria by neutrophils,29<sub> enhancement of</sub>
</p>
<p>nitric oxide production30<sub> and increased expression of tis-</sub>
</p>
<p>sue factor.31<sub> However, the prolonged persistence of stim-</sub>
</p>
<p>uli can lead to overexpression of PTX3 and amplification
of these inflammatory pathways,28<sub> with resulting damage</sub>
</p>
<p>to the organism. Thus far, there are no known specific an-
tagonists to the action of PTX3. Therefore, there are no
data regarding blocking of this pathway and its repercus-
sions.
</p>
<p>Finally, the relevance of this study relies on the cur-
rent difficulty in early determination of the severity of
cirrhotic patients. Hemodynamic disturbances hinder
the use of SIRS criteria;32<sub> because the hyperdynamic</sub>
</p>
<p>circulatory state leads to tachycardia, beta-blocker use
by many of these patients reduces the heart rate and can
mask SIRS, hepatic encephalopathy can lead to tachyp-
nea and hypersplenism caused by congestion of the por-
tal system can lead to reductions in the number of
circulating leukocytes.33<sub> Added to these factors are the</sub>
</p>
<p>immunological changes associated with advanced liver
disease, probably related to deficiencies in the comple-
ment system, which impair the elimination of op-
sonized bacteria and increased bacterial
translocation.34-36<sub> This in turn predisposes patients with</sub>
</p>
<p>liver cirrhosis to infections. Furthermore, cultures of
micro-organisms knowingly take at least 24 to 48 h to
present results, which hampers their utility for diag-
nosing infectious complications. Therefore, it is im-
portant to find early markers of severity and mortality
to guide appropriate treatment.
</p>
<p><b>CONCLUSIONS</b>
</p>
<p>Circulating levels of PTX3 are increased in patients
with liver cirrhosis, particularly those with acute decom-
pensation. Serum PTX3 is related to the severity of the
disease, the presence of ACLF and 90-day mortality. These
results are promising and indicate a potential use for PTX3
as an inflammatory and prognostic biomarker for patients
with liver cirrhosis.
