<p>Although  oral  cancer  represents  3%  of  all  malignant  tumors  [1],
it  has  a  high  fatality  rate,  with  five-year  survival  rate  of  &lt;60%  [2], 
plus increasing incidence among younger adults [3]. The majority 
of oral cancers are oral squamous cell carcinomas. Oral malignant 
tumors  most  often  invade  jaw  bones  but  remain  undetected  and 
may lead to inadequate resection and results in recurrence. While 
falsely detected invasion may result in unnecessary bone resection. 
A high percentage of resected mandibles in oral cancers show no 
evidence  of  tumor  invasion,  [4-8]  stressing  the  need  for  accurate 
imaging methods. Such ablative surgeries are not only associated 
with  lengthy  operation  and  complicated  reconstruction  but  with 
significant loss of functional and esthetic integrity of mouth. Thus, 
it is important to diagnose the extent of the tumor as accurately as 
possible.
</p>
<p>A number of imaging techniques were investigated to assess the 
jaw bone invasion by tumors. There is no imaging modality that is 
adequately reliable when used alone [9]. Conventional radiography 
including  PR  is  insensitive  to  early  bone  changes,  [5,10-15]but 
provide  accurate  morphological  information  necessary  for  tumor 
localization  and  detection  of  structural  abnormalities.  However, 
some  studies  [4,8,10,16-20]have  concluded  that  nuclear  bone 
scan  is  a  highly  sensitive,  but  lack  structural  delineation.  So  it  is 
difficult to locate the focus. Therefore, the fusion of functional and 
static imaging may be more accurate in defining the surgical margin 
than individual imaging. The purpose of the study was to evaluate 
the accuracy of Tc scan, PR and their combination (Tc scan/PR) for 
assessing jaw bone invasion by oral cancer.
</p>
<p><b>MAterIAls And MethOds</b>
</p>
<p>Twenty  patients  were  randomly  recruited  in  this  study  from  our 
Oral  Medicine  and  Maxillofacial  Radiology  department  over  a 
period  of  two  years.  All  patients  provided  informed  consent  for 
investigation  with  technetium  bone  scan.  This  study  followed  the 
</p>
<p>ethical  standards  of  the  committee  on  human  experimentation  of 
the institution. All patients were evaluated for serum calcium, serum 
phosphorous  and  alkaline  phosphatase  to  rule  out  diseases  of 
bone  or  systemic  diseases  influencing  bone.  None  of  our  patient 
had diseases of bones, especially of jaw bones. All female patients 
were  investigated  for  pregnancies.  None  of  our  female  patient 
was  pregnant.  The  histopathological  diagnosis  in  all  cases  was 
squamous  cell  carcinoma  except  one  who  had  osteosarcoma  of 
mandible and was, therefore, excluded. The remaining 19 patients 
were  evaluated  for  presence  and  extent  of  jaw  bone  cancerous 
invasion by clinical examination and on PR and Tc scan. The data 
was  gathered  prospectively  but  evaluated  retrospectively.  They 
consisted  of  16  males  and  3  females,  aged  32  to  80  (mean  56) 
years. [Table/Fig-1] shows sites and TNM staging of the cancers. 
None  of  the  patient  had  recent  history  of  dental  extraction,  radio 
or chemotherapy. Each patient had oral cancer that was in, on or 
adjacent to the jaw bones. 
</p>
<p>The  radiographic  examination  and  the  nuclear  bone  scan  were 
performed  on  the  same  day  or  within  48h  of  each  other.  Bone 
scintigraphy  was  performed  with  a  dual  head  gamma  camera 
equipped with a parallel hole collimator. A dose of 10 to 20mCi (370 
to 740 MBq) of technetium-99m methylene diphosphonate (99<sub>Tc</sub>m 
</p>
<p>MDP) was injected intravenously and imaging was performed three 
hours later. Anterior and lateral projections of maxillofacial skeleton 
were performed. All 19 patients had undergone surgical excision of 
the tumor. 11(57.9%) patients had segmental bone resection and 
remaining 8 (42.1%) had marginal resection of the bone. Each surgical 
specimen  was  decalcified  and  sectioned  for  histopathological 
examination for final confirmation of bone invasion and its extent. 
First,  bone  scan  and  PR  were  assessed  independently  to  check 
out their efficacy when used alone. Tc scans were evaluated by a 
nuclear  medicine  physician  and  PRs  were  interpreted  by  an  oral 
radiologist. Here, bone invasion was considered positive when there 
was an increased or abnormal activity corresponding to the clinical 
site of the tumor. In second part, bone involvement was assessed 
</p>
<p><b>ABstrAct</b>
</p>
<p><b>Objective: The correct extension of cancer in the bone usually </b>
remains  undetected  on  static  imaging  which  may  lead  to 
inadequate  or  over  excision.  The  conventional  radiography 
as  well  as  other  anatomical  imaging  modalities  like  computed 
tomography,  magnetic  resonance  imaging  often  fails  to  detect 
functional  changes  in  the  bone.  However,  bone  scinitigraphy 
is  highly  sensitive  in  detecting  earlier  changes  in  the  bone  but 
lack  anatomical  definition.  The  purpose  of  the  study  was  to 
evaluate  the  accuracy  of  combining  technetium-99m  bone 
scan and panoramic radiography (Tc scan/PR) over using single 
diagnostic  modality  in  detection  of  jaw  bone  invasion  by  oral 
carcinomas.  The  accuracy  of  these  imaging  modalities  either 
alone or in combination were determined by comparing with the 
histopathological findings. 
</p>
<p><b>Materials and Methods: Twenty patients with biopsy-proven oral </b>
malignant  tumors  were  randomly  selected  from  Oral  Medicine 
and Radiology department over a period of two years. All patients 
were  investigated  preoperatively  by  Tc  scan  and  PR.  Lewis  – 
Jones’s  designed  diagnostic  criterion  was  applied  on  Tc  scan/
PR to evaluate bone involvement by cancer. To test the accuracy 
of Tc scan, PR and Tc scan/PR, their results were compared with 
the histopathological findings of resected specimen.
</p>
<p><b>result: Hybrid Tc scan/PR had higher specificity, accuracy and </b>
positive  predictive  value  (83.3%,  94.7%,  92.8%)  than  Tc  scan 
alone (50%, 84.2%, 81.2%) and higher sensitivity and negative 
predictive value (100%, 100%) than PR (69.2%, 55.5%).
</p>
<p><b>conclusion: Combination of Tc scan and PR was more accurate </b>
in detecting jaw bone invasion by oral squamous cell carcinoma 
than Tc scan and PR alone.

<p>Comparative evaluation of the efficacy of clinical, PR, Tc scan and Tc 
scan/PR with histopathological findings in determining the jaw bone 
invasion by SCC is shown in [Table/Fig-1]. The diagnostic accuracy 
of  Clinical  findings,  PR,  Tc  scan  alone  and  with  PR  according  to 
the gold standard (microscopic examination) are shown in [Table/
Fig-2-5].  Tc  scan/PR  had  higher  sensitivity  (100%),  specificity 
(83.3%), accuracy (94.7%), PPV (92.8%) and NPV (100%) than PR

<p><b>dIscussIOn</b>
</p>
<p>One of the treatment modality of oral cancer is surgery consisting of 
marginal and segmental bone resection. Politi et al., suggested that 
the cases most suitable for marginal resection are those with no bone 
invasion, but requiring bone removal to ensure good tumor margins 
because of the proximity of the cancer to the jaw [21]. Tumor enters 
the mandible at the point of contact, which is often at the junction 
of the attached and reflected mucosa, [22] leading to acceptance 
of the view of marginal resection. The erosion pattern of the disease 
is  associated  with  shallow  mandibular  invasion,  or  invasive  bone 
defects confined to a superficial area of the alveolar bone [22,23], 
they  stated  that  marginal  resection  was  thought  effective.  Ideally, 
the resected margin in the bone and soft tissues should be clear 
of tumor by at least 5mm [24]. Close resection of margins of tumor 
within  5mm  of  the  edge,  were  associated  with  high  incidence  of 
early recurrence and poor prognosis [25]. Therefore, preoperative 
information concerning the extent of jaw bone invasion is a most 
important issue. 
</p>
<p>CT  (computed  tomography)  was  anatomical  imaging  modality, 
provides  accurate  morphological  information  necessary  for  tumor 
localization  and  detection  of  structural  abnormalities,  but  can 
not  reflect  the  functional  or  metabolic  activity  of  the  tumor  [26]. 
Yamamoto  et  al.,  [27]  reported  that,  only  5  of  the  13  patients  in 
whom histopathology revealed mandibular invasion were identified 
on CT, while in 9 patients, the CT image was obscure because of 
dental artifacts. Shaha [28] confirmed that CT is not very useful in 
detecting bone invasion because of the presenceof irregular dental 
sockets.Furthermore, dental amalgam artifacts and beam-hardening 
artifacts  from  the  dense  mandible  may  obscure  CT  imaging  [29]. 
The specificity of MRI was significantly lower than that of CT due 
to  chemical  shift  artifact  by  bone  marrow  fat  that  obscured  the 
black line of the cortex [30,31]. The subset of ferromagnetic metals 
and certain other metals causing radiofrequency and power tissue 
maldistribution cause artifacts on MRI [29]. Another disadvantage of

swallowing. However, CT is useful when there is gross involvement 
of  bone  as  well  as  soft  tissue  but  less  successful  in  early  bone 
invasion or new periosteal bone formation. 
</p>
<p>Some investigators recommend using two or more modalities that 
can  complement  each  other.  Clinical  judgment  and  conventional 
radiographs are accurate in cases when there is gross involvement 
of bone (17 of 19) but are significantly less successful in determining 
early  bone  invasion  [11].  However,  a  combination  of  panoramic 
radiography  and  bone  scintigraphy  is  recommended  in  early 
invasion [32].
</p>
<p>Another  important  clinical  parameter  was  fixation  of  tumor  to 
underlying bone. Tumor fixation to bone was present in 14 cases, 
we  found  13  true  positive.  False  positive  case  was  on  the  oral 
floor and seems to be attached to the lingual cortex. In a study 
by Caroline et al., [9], clinical assessment results in overdiagnosis 
leading  to  high  sensitivity  and  low  specificity.  Clinical  evaluation 
was little overestimated in our case and most importantly not able 
to determine the correct extent of bone involvement. But it gave 
more  useful  information  regarding  tumor,  its  site,  size,  proximity 
and  fixation  with  underlying  bone  for  diagnosis  and  treatment 
planning. 
</p>
<p>The determination of clinical bone invasion largely depends on the 
proximity (P) and fixity (F) of the tumor with the bone. In addition, 
high T-value (T) favors it because larger the size higher the chance of 
contact. Higher the PFT higher is the chance of bone involvement. 
Tumor  cells  usually  follow  least  resistance  pathway;  hence  bone 
invasion through dense cortical margin usually happens last except in 
high PFT. Bone invasion is unrelated to nodal involvement. Accuracy 
of  clinical  assessment  in  terms  of  bone  involvement  (sensitivity 
92.3%,  specificity  50%,  accuracy  78.9%,  PPV  80%,  NPV  75%) 
was almost similar with plain Tc scan. Clinical examination especially 
the  intraoperative  one  after  periosteal  stripping  as  described  by 
Brown  et  al.,  [33]  is  accurate  in  detecting  bone  invasion  but  has 
disadvantage of low specificity. It is also affected by irregular dental 
sockets due to periodontitis. 
</p>
<p>In  our  study,  hybrid  Tc  scan/PR  was  used  with  Lewis-Jones’s 
diagnostic criteria [6] to evaluate bone invasion by oral cancer. Its 
specificity, accuracy and PPV were higher than single Tc scan. Our 
study  showed  50%  specificity,  84.2%  accuracy  and  81.2%  PPV 
with  Tc  scan  but  83.3%  specificity,  94.7%  accuracy  and  92.8% 
PPV  using  Tc  scan/PR.  Lewis-Jones  et  al.,  [6]  reported  100% 
sensitivity,  100%  NPV,  86%  specificity  and  92%  PPV  by  using 
combination  of  these  two  complementing  modalities.  In  another

patients) in determining the full extent of tumor involvement in jaw 
bones [34]. Some studies found that combination of real and rear 
time imaging was more precise over single modality [6,11,13,19,32, 
35]. Sensitivity and NPV obtained by us were 100% with Tc scan 
when  used  either  alone  or  in  Tc  scan/PR  compared  to  PR  alone 
(69.2%, 55.5%). The low sensitivity and NPV of PR is because of 
its anatomic (static) rather than functional radiography and sufficient 
demineralization or remineralization (36%) is required to be visible on 
conventional radiograph. PR is a tomograph so early changes in the 
structure outside the focal trough will not be noticed; furthermore 
it is a two dimensional view of three dimensional object leading to 
superimposition on the smaller changes. The values of PR is further 
restricted because of double images, ghost shadows, thin anterior 
focal trough and cervical superimpositions. Some studies found PR 
specific for revealing periapical or periodontal infections that may be 
misinterpreted by other imaging modalities [13,14]. With histological 
findings as the standard of reference, PR was found to be 100% 
specific  in  a  study  carried  out  on  15  patients  [20].  A  negative  Tc 
scan  rules  out  bone  invasion  (100%  sensitivity,  100%  NPV).  We 
assessed  5  of  6  patients  correctly  on  Tc  scan/PR  as  not  having 
bone involvement. 
</p>
<p>Weisman et al., [4] found a 53% false positive rate with bone scinti-
graphy  as  a  result  of  mandibular  inflammatory  changes.  Gilbert 
et  al.,  [10]  also  showed  that  the  false  positive  rate  with  bone 
scintigraphy was 50% (3/6). We had 50% of false positive rate with 
bone  scintigraphy  but  it  was  reduced  to  16.7%  when  scintiscan 
used with PR under outlined criteria. Our specificity with Tc scan/
PR was relatively low (83.3%) partly because our patient population 
without bone invasion was small (6 of 19 patients).
</p>
<p>There were three false positive cases when bone scintigraphy used 
alone because of corresponding dental diseases. Two of them were 
correctly identified by outlined criteria as there was no increase in 
size of the uptake on scintiscan corresponding to the actual size of 
the dental diseases on PR. Chan et al., [36] suggested that lesion 
to  non-lesion  ratio  (uptake)  in  mandibular  invasion  by  using  Tc 
SPECT were significantly higher than in those with normal mandible 
or  dental  disease.  But  the  third  patient  had  severe  periodontal 
bone  loss  associated  with  large  apical  ill-defined  rarefying  ostitis 
corresponding  to  the  site  of  the  tumor  and  was,  therefore  falsely 
identified  as  positive  even  on  Tc  scan/PR.  In  this  case,  we  were 
unable to determine mandibular invasion with certainty even though 
the size of the uptake was equal to size of the periodontal disease 
on  PR.  This  uncertainty  is  because  severe  periodontal  bone  loss 
usually opens door for overlying/adjacent tumor to invade medullary 
cavity. As the final radiology report suggested bone invasion, they 
were listed as positive for the purpose of the study. But clinically, 
bone  invasion  was  not  suspected  as  tumor  was  located  on  the 
mouth floor [Table/Fig-6], not immediate and fixed to the bone. This 
case clearly indicates the importance of clinical judgment.
</p>
<p>The  superficial  cortical  erosion  is  not  included  under  definition  of 
bone  invasion  which,  according  to  accepted  TNM  classification, 
requires  complete  cortical  penetration  [37].  Bone  scan  can  be 
positive  even  in  superficial  erosion  as  well  as  periosteal  reaction 
however such involvement show microscopic invasion and should 
be recommended for marginal resection. In our study, the decision 
to proceed bone resection especially the marginal one was based 
on clinical and radiological evaluation and intraoperative assessment 
of bone invasion by stripping the periosteum. 
</p>
<p>Of  the  13  true  positives,  four  were  with  gross  bone  involvement 
and  all  of  them  were  identified  on  PR.  The  cortical  penetration 
with cancellous bone invasion was present in 7 patients; PR was 
correct in 5 cases. The remaining 2 cases had superficial cortical 
erosion. Panoramic radiography was false negative [Table/Fig-7] but 
scinitiscan was true positive [Table/Fig-8] in these four cases. This 
indicated  that  the  scintigraphic  technique  may  be  more  sensitive 
</p>
<p>in  detecting  early  bone  changes  than  panoramic  radiography.  In 
eight  cases  including  four  with  gross  involvement,  the  extent  of 
lesion demonstrated by scintiscanning was greater than delineated 
by  panoramic  radiography;  histopathology  of  resected  specimen 
confirmed this findings. Bone scintigraphy was superior in showing 
correct  extent  of  the  lesion.  Baker  et  al.,  [12]  reported  similar 
findings.
</p>
<p>There were no instances of an abnormal radiograph with a normal 
bone  scintigraph.  In  1996,  Higashi  et  al.,  [38]  reported  similar 
observation in their study. In our study, there was no false negative 
result  on  Tc  scan  when  used  either  alone  or  in  combination 
indicates its extreme sensitivity. But few studies with false negative 
results  [4,17,33]  were  observed.  Such  cases  may  arise  because 
of  misinterpretation  of  adjacent  or  opposite  side  dental  disease 
on scintiscan. Tc scan/PR using outlined criteria can be helpful in 
resolving such misreading. PR provides an excellent general survey 
of the jaws; in addition dental diseases are better diagnosed and 
differentiated  on  it.  Thus,  it  provides  complementary  information 
regarding coincidental dental diseases and considerably increases 
specificity of bone scintigraphy. 
</p>
<p><b>cOnclusIOn </b>
</p>
<p>Hybrid Tc scan/PR has high sensitivity and specificity in detecting 
the  existence  and  extent  of  malignant  bone  infiltration.  Although 
the sensitivity of Tc scan is similar to that of Tc scan/PR, the latter 
provides a much better delineation of the tumor and dental foci in 
spite  of  two  dimensions.  Based  on  this  information,  the  surgical 
margin of the tumor can be planned and performed more precisely. 
Patient outcome can be improved by avoiding undertreatment and 
unnecessary excisions.
