ABSTRACT
Exit from mitosis is as an important phase in the cell cycle. The molecular event that triggers the cell cycle transition from anaphase into the G1 state involves the
inactivation of the cyclin-dependent kinase complex (Cdk) through multiple mechanisms that lead to both destruction of the cyclin subunit co-activator and direct Cdk kinase inhibition. These multiple mechanisms indicate the importance of regulating the
inactivation of Cdk to ensure proper cell cycle progression and cytokinesis. We set out to examine the regulation of the protein phosphatase Cdc14. Cdc14 is thought to act through reversal of phosphorylation on key Cdk substrates that promote mitotic exit by stimulating the destruction and inactivation of Cdk. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, activation of Cdc14 is achieved via release from its nucleolar inhibitor Net1/Cfi1. This activation is correlated with multi-site phosphorylation of Net1 in cells where Cdc14 appears to be released from the nucleolus. We set out to identify new components of the nucleolar complex known as RENT (Regulator of Nucleolar Silencing and Teleophase) which holds Cdc14 in an
inactive state. This led to the identification of Casein Kinase II (CKII) as a new component of RENT. CKII was verified to co-immunoprecipitate with Net1; and mutants in CKII arrest in anaphase with unreleased Cdc14 and unsegregated rDNA. Interestingly, phospho- peptide mapping experiments from in vivo Net1 samples revealed phosphorylation of a CKII consensus sequence within Net1. In vivo mapping also revealed another subset of sites that matched the consensus sequence established for Cdk phosphorylation. Mutational analysis of these sites unveiled their involvement in Cdc14 release during early anaphase and a role for a network of genetically interacting proteins involved in Fourteen Early Anaphase Release (FEAR) in promoting these phosphorylations.Page 6

         In summary, the regulation of Cdc14 release via phosphorylation of its nucleolar inhibitor Net1 as demonstrated by this work highlights the importance of nucleolar sequesteration and regulated release as a mechanism of controlling important cell cycle factors and events. It also points to a fascinating role for Cdk in insuring its own destruction at the end of the cell cycle, thus promoting transition back into the G1 state.Page 7

C h a p t e r   I -   T h e   E n d   o f   t h e   C e l l   C y c l e
Overview: The motor of the cell cycle; Cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) The ability of cells to coordinate important events such as spindle disassembly (Li and Cai, 1997), chromosomal condensation (Loidl, 2003), and DNA replication (Piatti, 1997) with cellular division rely on the activity of the cyclin-dependent kinase complex (Amon et al., 1994; Holloway et al., 1993; Surana et al., 1993). The Cdk complex consists of at least two components in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The first is a cyclin subunit that both activates and is thought to impart substrate specificity to the second component, the kinase subunit.  The cyclin subunit appears to be interchangeable during various phases of the cell cycle where G1 cyclins (Cln1,2,3) (Levine et al., 1995); S-phase cyclins (Clb5,6) (Kuntzel et al., 1996; Toone et al., 1997); and G2 cyclins (Clb1,2,3,4) (Fitch et al., 1992) activate the kinase subunit to effect phosphorylation on cell cycle-specific substrates. Direct regulation of the kinase subunit in cis involves the post-translational
phosphorylation of key residues that lead to modification of enzymatic activity
(Mendenhall and Hodge, 1998).  Regulation of the Cdk complex in trans also plays a key role in S. cerevisiae. This is achieved through the action of Cdk inhibitors (Sic1) (Donovan et al., 1994) and (Cdc6) (Calzada et al., 2001) which directly bind to and inhibit Cdk complexes.
This work focuses on the regulation of Cdk activity at the end of the cell cycle during mitotic exit. Specifically, the regulation of the molecular trigger both in cis and in trans that signals the cells to initiate Cdk inactivation via the various mechanisms listed previously.  We will demonstrate the ability of the cell cycle motor Cdk to act as its ownPage 11

break, in effect, by regulating the activation of the molecular trigger that leads to the ultimate extinction of Cdk activity, thus paving the road for the return back to the G1 state.
Exit from mitosis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae The Mitotic Exit Network (MEN)
To achieve the goal of Cdk inactivation by the various mechanisms listed
previously, a signal transduction network has been identified to be involved in mitotic exit. This group of proteins consists of at least 10 genetically interacting proteins collectively known as the mitotic exit network (MEN) (Jaspersen et al., 1998; McCollum and Gould, 2001). They include 4 protein kinases (Cdc15, Cdc5, Dbf2, and Dbf20) (Johnston et al., 1990; Kitada et al., 1993; Schweitzer and Philippsen, 1991; Toyn et al., 1991), a spindle pole body (SPB) protein (Nud1) (Adams and Kilmartin, 1999), a protein phosphatase (Cdc14) (Wan et al., 1992), a GTPase (Tem1) (Shirayama et al., 1994), a GTP/GDP exchange protein (Lte1) (Shirayama et al., 1994), a negative regulator of Cdc15 (Amn1) (Wang et al., 2003), and a protein of unknown function (Mob1) (Luca and Winey, 1998). All of the MEN proteins, with the exception of Lte1, are essential in budding yeast and many are found to be conserved between yeast and higher eukaryotic organisms (Li et al., 1997; Li et al., 2000).
A model for how exit from mitosis is controlled involves the retention of Cdc14 in an inactive form within the nucleolus while tethered to the nucleolar protein (Net1/Cfi1) (Shou et al., 1999; Visintin et al., 1999).  Upon activation of the MEN, Cdc14 is released from Net1, and diffuses throughout the cell. The active form of Cdc14 is thought to activatePage 12

cyclin proteolysis by removing inhibitory phosphorylation from Hct1/Cdh1, an activator of APC in late anaphase (Jaspersen et al., 1999; Visintin et al., 1998; Zachariae et al., 1998). Cdc14 is also thought to be responsible for promoting Sic1 accumulation and stability by reversal of Cdk phosphorylation events on Swi5 (a Sic1 transcriptional activator) and Sic1, respectively (Moll et al., 1991; Toyn et al., 1991; Toyn et al., 1997; Verma et al., 1997; Visintin et al., 1998).
Evidence suggests that the MEN acts as part of the Bub2-dependent spindle positioning checkpoint that monitors spindle pole body (SPB) position with respect to the bud neck (Bardin et al., 2000; Bloecher et al., 2000; Pereira et al., 2000).  Upon spindle pole body duplication, the old spindle pole body is thought to contain the Tem1 GTPase which migrates to the bud. Activation of Tem1 occurs as the SPB interacts with the Bud cortex containing the GTP/GDP exchange protein Lte1 (Bardin et al., 2000; Bloecher et al., 2000; Pereira et al., 2000).  Tem1 then in turn is thought to activate Cdc15 kinase
(Asakawa et al., 2001; Bardin et al., 2003) which in turn leads to the activation of the Dbf2/Dbf20 kinase complex bound to the cyclin-like subunit Mob1 (Mah et al., 2001; Visintin and Amon, 2001). It remains unclear how the Dbf2/Dbf20/Mob1 complex then controls the activation of Cdc14 to promote mitotic exit. One possible role for the action of MEN involves the control of Cdc14’s ability to transition between the nucleus and
cytoplasm where the majority of its identified substrates reside.  Indeed, genetic screens have identified a few nuclear transporters as suppressors of MEN mutants such as SUP1, KAP104, and MTR10 (Asakawa and Toh-e, 2002; Shou and Deshaies, 2002; Shou et al., 2001; Shou et al., 1999), yet it remains unknown as to whether these transporter act directly on Cdc14 or indirectly through general perturbation of nuclear/nucleolar architecture toPage 13

allow precocious release of Cdc14 independently of MEN function. Indeed, Net1
mutations such as net1-1 have a significant impact on general nucleolar structure as judged by localization of multiple nucleolar antigens and regulation of rDNA morphology (Shou et al., 2001), which helps to explain this allele’s ability to bypass cdc15 ∆  cells (Shou et al., 1999).  It is clear though that the cell cycle function of Net1 can be uncoupled from its other nucleolar functions as demonstrated by the dominant mutation in CDC14 (TAB6) (Shou et al., 1999).
Fourteen Early Anaphase Release (FEAR) Network
Recently, a new network of proteins has been identified in regulating the release of Cdc14 from the nucleolus in early anaphase (Stegmeier et al., 2002).  This network consists of a separase (Esp1), the polo-like kinase (Cdc5), Spo12, and Slk19 which have unknown functions.
The first component of this network is a protease known as separase (Esp1)
(Uhlmann et al., 2000).  Esp1 is held inactive by securin (Pds1) (Cohen-Fix and Koshland, 1999; Yamamoto et al., 1996) until the metaphase to anaphase transition, at which point it is activated to promote destruction of cohesin (Scc1) (Ciosk et al., 1998).  Cohesin holds sister chromatids together after DNA replication and its enzymatic cleavage by separase allows separation of the sister chromatids to the opposite SPB ends (Uhlmann et al., 2000). Notably, the enzymatic activity of Esp1 does not appear to be required for its function in the FEAR pathway as catalytically inactive Esp1 is still able to promote Cdc14 release in metaphase-arrested cells (Sullivan and Uhlmann, 2003).   Also, over-expression of Esp1Page 14

allows metaphase-arrested cells to complete mitosis and cycle to the next G1 phase but is dependent on Spo12, Slk19, and to a lesser extent Cdc5 (Sullivan and Uhlmann, 2003).
The second component is (Cdc5), the only known homolog to the polo kinase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.  Cdc5 is interesting because it acts as both a component of the MEN as well as the FEAR networks.  Cdc5 is thought to act in the MEN pathway through inhibitory phosphorylations of the Bub2/Bfa1 complex which leads to the activation of Tem1 (Hu et al., 2001).  Cdc5 is also thought to act on the RENT complex to promote Cdc14 release from Net1, although this is thought to be primarily through an indirect mechanism (Shou et al., 2002).  The function of Cdc5 in the FEAR pathway is less clear, whereas over-expression of Cdc5 can promote Cdc14 release in metaphase-arrested cells, it appears to be independent of the other FEAR network genes (Sullivan and Uhlmann, 2003; Visintin et al., 2003).
The third component of the FEAR is Spo12, a protein of unknown function. Spo12 was originally identified as playing an important role in the proper progression of meiosis (Klapholz and Esposito, 1980a; Klapholz and Esposito, 1980b).  Interestingly, Spo12 levels appear to be cell-cycle regulated (Shah et al., 2001) and functions as a multi-copy
suppressor of cdc15-2 temperature sensitive strains (Jaspersen et al., 1998).  Also, the role of Spo12 in promoting Cdc14 release appears to be in parallel to the other components of the FEAR network, as over-expression of Spo12 still drives Cdc14 out of the nucleolus in FEAR mutants (Visintin et al., 2003).  Recently, Spo12 has been suggested to antagonize the function of the nucleolar protein (Fob1), thus promoting the premature release of Cdc14 from the RENT complex in metaphase-arrested cells (Stegmeier et al., 2004).Page 15

The fourth component of this network is Slk19, another protein of unknown function. Slk19 was originally identified and later confirmed to be required for the proper maintenance of mitotic anaphase spindles (Sullivan et al., 2001; Zeng et al., 1999).  Slk19 localizes to kinetochores and the spindle mid-zone during anaphase and is a substrate of Esp1, yet interestingly cleavage of Slk19 by Esp1 does not seem to be necessary for Cdc14 release from the nucleolus (Stegmeier et al., 2002).  The function of Slk19 in the FEAR pathway could also be complicated by the fact that Slk19 appears to be required upstream to promote Cdc14 release through the FEAR pathway yet also required for Cdc14 function downstream to promote anaphase spindle integrity through Cdc14 mediated localization of the INCENP-Aurora B complex to the spindle midzone (Pereira and Schiebel, 2003).
Roles of FEAR
In a relatively short amount of time, the FEAR network has been implicated to play a key role in organizing multiple events during early anaphase.  FEAR was initially
identified as a group of proteins required for the timely progression through mitosis by promoting the release of Cdc14 in early anaphase (Stegmeier et al., 2002).  Cdc14 is then able to positively feed back and activate the kinase Cdc15 as part of the MEN pathway as has been proposed previously (Jaspersen and Morgan, 2000).  FEAR mutants, in the context of mitosis, displayed a delay in proper progression through mitosis, and synthetic phenotypes when combined with MEN mutants (Stegmeier et al., 2002).
Recent studies have illuminated another role for FEAR in the coordination of MI and MII phases during meiosis (Buonomo et al., 2003; Marston et al., 2003) and properPage 16

segregation of rDNA (Buonomo et al., 2003).  Anaphase I spindle disassembly is delayed in cdc14-1, spo12 ∆ , and slk19 ∆  mutants to the point where anaphase II equational division occurs on meiosis I spindles (Marston et al., 2003).  Remarkably, meiosis II events still take place and deletion of SPO11, preventing recombination, rescues the nuclear division defect of these mutants (Marston et al., 2003). Both Spo12 and Slk19 appear to be critical for executing meiosis than mitosis as judged by the sporulation and meiotic defects of spo12 ∆  and slk19 ∆  mutant cells (Buonomo et al., 2003; Grether and Herskowitz, 1999; Klapholz and Esposito, 1980b; Zeng et al., 1999). Mutant spo12∆ asci contain only two spores and half of slk19∆ contain two and half three or four spores (unpublished
observations) (Marston et al., 2003). More so, Spo12 and Slk19 are required for the division of the nucleolus (specifically, the segregation of newly replicated rDNA) and release of Cdc14 during Anaphase I of meiosis implying that Cdc14 release and activation is important for nucleolar segregation as has been suggested previously for cells exiting mitosis (Granot and Snyder, 1991). The polo kinase Cdc5 has also been linked to
controlling chromosomal segregation during meiosis I (Lee and Amon, 2003).  Removal of meiotic cohesin from chromosomes and sister-kinetochore co-orientation during meiosis I are coupled through their dependence on Cdc5 (Lee and Amon, 2003).
More recently, a new function of FEAR has been attributed to the controlling the proper transfer of the INCENP-Aurora B complex from the kinetochore to the spindle midzone (Pereira and Schiebel, 2003).  Release of Cdc14 in early anaphase leads to the dephosphorylation of Sli15, a component of the INCEP-Aurora complex composed of Sli15-Ipl1. This dephosphorylation occurs on Cdk sites of Sli15 through Cdc14’sPage 17

phosphatase activity in vitro (Pereira and Schiebel, 2003) which corresponds with Cdc14 being a proline-directed phosphatase (Gray et al., 2003).  Sli15 dephosphorylation is
sufficient to trigger microtubule binding of the INCEP-Aurora complex as demonstrated by the Sli15-6A mutant which remarkably is able to rescue the spindle defect of cdc14-2 mutant cells. Mutant Sli15-6A cells also displayed a 1000-fold increase in chromosome loss rate due to constitutive localization of Ipl1 and consequent stabilization of microtubules (Pereira and Schiebel, 2003) again arguing that proper activation of Cdc14 in early anaphase is important for timely progression through the cell cycle towards mitotic exit.
FEAR and Mitotic Exit Networks in Meiosis and Mitosis
Exit from anaphase is similar in meiosis and mitosis in that it requires the down- regulation of Cdk1 activity.  However, in contrast to the exit from mitosis which is brought about by a complete loss of M-phase Cdk activity, the exit from meiosis I is accompanied by only a partial reduction perhaps because modest levels of Cdk1 activity appear to be required in the interval between meiosis I and II to prevent DNA replication and origin resetting (Iwabuchi et al., 2000; Noton and Diffley, 2000). Interestingly, the FEAR network appears to perform similar functions in both M-phases: it creates a brief window of Cdc14 activity that antagonizes Clb-Cdk to initiate a collapse of the M-phase state.  In meiosis, the transient reduction in the M-phase state appears to be brief and only necessary for partial reversal of the M-phase state to allow for the remodeling of the microtubule spindle to support equational segregation of sister chromosomes during meiosis II.  For this, the FEAR appears to be both necessary and sufficient, and the MEN does not appear to play a critical role (Buonomo et al., 2003; Marston et al., 2003).  However, in mitotic cycles, Clb-Page 18

Cdk activity must be completely extinguished to enable an irreversible return to an interphase state that can support DNA replication.  This requirement in turn may
necessitate a more extended release of Cdc14 from the nucleolus, which requires the MEN. Positive feedback loops built into the MEN (Jaspersen and Morgan, 2000) may act to ensure that once the MEN is switched on, Clb-Cdk activity will inevitably be extinguished completely to allow the cell to divide and enter a subsequent S phase.  Owing to these positive feedback loops, even a very modest initial stimulus could snowball into a complete mobilization of Cdc14, which could explain why the FEAR is not essential in mitotic cycles.
Conversely, the budding lifestyle of Saccharomyces cerevisiae offers a simple explanation for why the FEAR may not be sufficient to drive exit from mitosis (in contrast to the situation at the completion of meiosis I).  Accurate partitioning of sister
chromosomes to mother and daughter yeast cells is supported by a post-anaphase
checkpoint that monitors the position of the spindle relative to the bud neck (Bardin et al., 2000; Pereira et al., 2000).  If the FEAR by itself could drive exit from mitosis, then the cell would be irreversibly committed to exit mitosis upon activation of separase at the metaphase-anaphase transition, regardless of whether the two sets of sister chromatids were properly distributed to the two daughter cells.
Thesis Overview
Although the action of the FEAR network is not essential for mitotic cell cycles, its activity helps to determine the timing of exit from mitosis (Stegmeier et al., 2002).  ChapterPage 19

II describes how phosphorylation of Net1 by Clb-Cdk underlies disruption of the RENT complex during anaphase and illustrates a fascinating aspect of the switch that governs the return of mitotic cells to an interphase state.  Although Clb-Cdk initiates feedback loops that help sustain a mitotic state with high Clb-Cdk activity (Deshaies, 1997), there must be mechanisms for subverting the reign of Clb-Cdk to allow growing cells to continue to cycle.  Fittingly, at least two of these mechanisms – activation of Cdc20 binding to APC (Rudner et al., 2000; Rudner and Murray, 2000) and disruption of the Cdc14/Net1 complex – are initiated directly by the very enzyme whose activity helps to specify the mitotic state in the first place.  Chapter III describes the identification of new interactors with the RENT complex such as Casein kinase II (CKII) and RNA polymerase I in mitotic cells.  Given that a CKII site was identified and mapped from in vivo samples of Net1, and CKII was found co-associated with RENT complexes by mass spectrometry and this association was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation; CKII could be playing an important role in
regulating Cdc14 release and possibly rDNA segregation. Also, given the location of the RENT complex within the nucleolus, interactions of Net1 with RNA Pol I help explain the multi-functionality displayed by net1-1 mutants.   Chapter IV will outline a potential line of experiments that address how regulation of the FEAR and MEN pathways could be
investigated through the use of Clb2–Cdk phosphorylation assays on Net1 and how these phosphorylations lead to the activation of Cdc14.

Summary
The Cdc14 Early Anaphase Release (FEAR) network promotes a transition in the M-phase state that demarcates meiosis I and II, and together with the mitotic exit network enables timely exit from mitosis.  These functions derive from FEAR’s ability to promote release of active Cdc14 from the nucleolar anchor Net1/Cfi1.  We report here a molecular basis for the release of Cdc14 during early anaphase.  Mitotic cyclin Clb2–Cdk
complexes phosphorylate Net1 in vitro and in vivo.  Underscoring the relevance of these phosphorylations, net1 phosphosite and clb1∆clb2∆ mutants are deficient in FEAR, and net1 phosphosite mutants fail to execute proper meiosis.  Over-expression of non-
degradable Clb2 induces ectopic release of Cdc14 from the nucleolus, and purified Clb2- Cdk dissociates Cdc14 from Net1 in vitro.  Finally, FEAR network components Spo12, Slk19, and Cdc5 promote Net1 phosphorylation by Clb–Cdk.  These results suggest that the FEAR network mobilizes Clb1,2-Cdk to phosphorylate Net1 and dislodge Cdc14, which initiates a transient (meiosis I) or sustained (mitosis) departure from M-phase via down-regulation of Clb-Cdk activity.  Thus, Clb-Cdk sows the seeds of its own demise.Page 32

Introduction
Exit from mitosis is an essential step in the progression of cells through the cell cycle.  In late mitosis, inactivation of mitotic cyclin–Cdk complexes causes mitotic spindle disassembly (Li and Cai, 1997), chromosome decondensation, and return of cells to G1 phase (Amon et al., 1994; Holloway et al., 1993; Surana et al., 1993).  In budding yeast, this inactivation is achieved by accumulation of the Cdk inhibitor Sic1 (Donovan et al., 1994; Schwab et al., 1997; Visintin et al., 1998), and destruction of the mitotic cyclins by the Anaphase Promoting Complex (APC), a multi-subunit ubiquitin protein ligase that catalyzes the ubiquitination of substrates containing a destruction-box sequence (Glotzer et al., 1991; Irniger et al., 1995; King et al., 1995; Morgan, 1999).  Both of these
processes require a network of genetically interacting proteins collectively known as the mitotic exit network (MEN) (Jaspersen et al., 1998; McCollum and Gould, 2001).  The most upstream component is the spindle pole body (SPB) protein Nud1 (Adams and Kilmartin, 1999), which tethers MEN components to the SPB.  Among those components is the GTPase Tem1 (Shirayama et al., 1994b), which is activated by the guanine
nucleotide exchange factor Lte1 (Shirayama et al., 1994a).  The location of Lte1 in the bud cortex is thought to render Tem1 activation dependent upon successful orientation of the anaphase spindle along the mother-bud axis (Bardin et al., 2000; Pereira et al., 2000). Activated Tem1 then promotes activation of the protein kinase Cdc15 (Schweitzer and Philippsen, 1991), which in turn activates the homologous protein kinases Dbf2 and Dbf20 (Johnston et al., 1990; Toyn et al., 1991).  Proper activation of Dbf2 requires its association with its binding partner Mob1 (Luca and Winey, 1998; Mah et al., 2001). MEN components Cdc15, Dbf2, Dbf20, and Mob1, like Tem1, localize to the SPB (LucaPage 33

et al., 2001; Pereira et al., 2002; Visintin and Amon, 2001; Yoshida and Toh-e, 2001). Activation of Cdc14, a protein phosphatase (Wan et al., 1992) that serves as a key
mediator of mitotic exit, appears to be the eventual target of the MEN, yet the mechanism by which this activation occurs remains unknown.
During interphase, Cdc14 is retained in an inactive form within the nucleolus as a component of the RENT complex, which comprises Cdc14 and Sir2 tethered to the nucleolar protein Net1/Cfi1 (Shou et al., 1999; Straight et al., 1999; Visintin et al., 1999). During anaphase, active Cdc14 is released from Net1, and diffuses throughout the cell. Cdc14 is thought to activate cyclin proteolysis by removing inhibitory phosphate groups from Hct1/Cdh1, an activator of APC in late anaphase (Jaspersen et al., 1999; Visintin et al., 1998; Zachariae et al., 1998).  Cdc14 also promotes Sic1 accumulation and stability by removal of Cdk phosphorylations on Swi5 (a Sic1 transcriptional activator) and Sic1, respectively (Moll et al., 1991; Toyn et al., 1997; Verma et al., 1997; Visintin et al., 1998).
Recently, Cdc5, Esp1, Spo12, and Slk19 have been proposed to comprise a
signaling network (dubbed the FEAR network for Fourteen Early Anaphase Release) that instigates transient release of Cdc14 from Net1 at the onset of anaphase (Stegmeier et al., 2002).  Cdc5 and Esp1 are, respectively, the polo kinase and separase orthologs of budding yeast.  The biochemical functions of Spo12 and Slk19 are unknown.  The FEAR network is required for proper coordination of chromosome segregation during meiosis I and II (Buonomo et al., 2003; Marston et al., 2003) but is not essential for exit from mitosis (Stegmeier et al., 2002).  Nevertheless, FEAR network mutants exhibit a modest delay in exiting mitosis, and strong synergy with MEN mutants.Page 34

Although the FEAR network plays a critical coordinating role in the M-phases of mitosis and meiosis, the molecular mechanisms underpinning FEAR’s ability to promote Cdc14 activation are not fully understood.  Investigations on the role of separase in this process demonstrated that ectopic disassembly of RENT induced by over-expression of separase is not affected by a point mutation that disrupts separase’s endoproteolytic
activity, but is blocked completely by deletion of SPO12 or SLK19, and partially in cdc5-1 temperature sensitive (ts) mutants (Sullivan and Uhlmann, 2003).  These observations suggest that a novel activity of Esp1 stimulates Spo12, Slk19, and Cdc5 to promote release of Cdc14 from Net1.  In contrast, over-expressed Cdc5 can promote ectopic release of Cdc14 from the nucleolus in spo12∆, slk19∆, and esp1-1 mutants, and over-expressed Spo12 accelerates the same event in slk19∆, esp1-1, and Cdc5-depleted cells.  These observations suggest that Spo12 and Cdc5 collaborate on parallel pathways to dislodge Cdc14 from Net1 (Visintin et al., 2003).  Interestingly, separase- and Cdc5-induced disassembly of RENT correlates with hyper-phosphorylation of Net1 (Shou et al., 2002a; Sullivan and Uhlmann, 2003; Visintin et al., 2003).  It has long been thought that
phosphorylation of Net1, Cdc14, or both underlies disassembly of the RENT complex during early and late anaphase (Shou et al., 2002a; Shou et al., 1999; Sullivan and
Uhlmann, 2003; Visintin et al., 2003).  Among the protein kinases in the MEN, Cdc5 has been implicated in controlling Net1 phosphorylation state and RENT disassembly (Shou et al., 2002a; Visintin et al., 2003; Yoshida and Toh-e, 2002), and has been postulated to be the direct effector of FEAR-induced Net1 phosphorylation (Ross and Cohen-Fix, 2003). However, the identity of the relevant protein kinases that phosphorylate RENT and the sites of in vivo phosphorylation remain uncertain.  Thus, it has not been possible to test directlyPage 35

the appealing hypothesis that phosphorylation underlies the release of Cdc14 from Net1 during anaphase.  We propose that mitotic Clb-Cdk phosphorylates Net1 to bring about Cdc14 release and activation and that this phsophorylation is regulated by components of the FEAR network.
Results
Net1 N-terminus mediates regulated localization of Cdc14 and is highly phosphorylated in cdc14-1 cells.
To map determinants that sustain regulated disassembly of the RENT complex, we examined a Net1 (1-621) truncation mutant along with a set of strains that contain
transposon insertions in NET1 (Burns et al., 1994; Ross-Macdonald et al., 1999).
Immuno-fluorescence analysis of asynchronous cell cultures using anti-Cdc14 antibodies revealed that the N-terminal 621 amino acid fragment of Net1 was both sufficient and necessary for proper nucleolar sequestration of Cdc14 in G1 phase and its release in anaphase cells (Figure 1).  Net1 is heavily phosphorylated in cdc14-1 ts cells arrested in anaphase (Shou et al., 1999), but less so in other MEN mutants (Shou et al., 2002b).  This observation suggested that the MEN controls phosphorylation of Net1, which in turn might underlie the release of Cdc14 during anaphase.  To test this hypothesis we purified Net1 from cdc14-1 arrested cells, and mapped sites of phosphorylation as described (Shou et al., 2002b).  Nineteen sites of phosphorylation were identified (Table 1).  Of these, we focused our attention on the N-terminal phosphorylations because the corresponding region was found to be necessary and sufficient to mediate proper cell cycle-regulated localization of Cdc14 (Figure 1).Page 36

Net1 phosphorylation is required for the transient release of Cdc14 in early anaphase and proper meiosis.
Endogenous NET1 was substituted by a mutant (net1-13m) allele in which thirteen, N-terminal, in vivo phosphorylation sites were converted to Alanine (Table1). The mutant protein, designated Net1-13m, localized to the nucleolus (data not shown) and directed the nucleolar localization of Cdc14 (Figure 7A).  However, net1-13m cells were deficient in the transient release of Cdc14 from the nucleolus that occurs during early anaphase (i.e., FEAR; compare Figure 7B to Figure 2B).  To determine which phosphorylation sites were responsible for the phenotype of net1-13m, we constructed mutants lacking subsets of sites.  This effort yielded a mutant lacking three CDK
consensus sites (hereafter referred to as net1-3Cdk) that almost completely recapitulated the phenotypes of net1-13m (Figures 2A, 2B), whereas another mutant (net1-3Ax) lacking the 3 non-Cdk consensus sites in the first 341 aa of Net1 displayed a very minor
reduction in FEAR (Figure 7C).  Upon further analysis of the phosphosite mapping data (see Experimental Procedures), we constructed an additional mutant lacking all six Cdk consensus sites in the first 341 aa of Net1 (hereafter referred to as net1-6Cdk).
Although FEAR is typically assayed in the context of a MEN mutant (e.g., cdc15ts), deletion of SPO12 in a wild-type background results in a delay in both release of Cdc14 from the nucleolus and exit from mitosis (Stegmeier et al., 2002).  To evaluate the role of Cdk phosphorylation on Net1 in an unperturbed cell cycle, we monitored Cdc14 localization and spindle elongation in wild-type, spo12∆, and net1-6Cdk cells released synchronously from  α  factor block in G1 phase.  There was a modest (10’) delayPage 37

in Cdc14 release from the nucleolus in net1-6Cdk mutants similar to that seen for
spo12 ∆  cells (Figure 8 and (Visintin et al., 2003).  A third phenotype exhibited by FEAR mutants is that they exhibit synthetic genetic phenotypes when combined with MEN mutants (Stegmeier et al., 2002).  Likewise, the net1-3Cdk and net1-6Cdk mutants showed synthetic-lethal interactions with the MEN mutants dbf2-2 (Figure 2C) and cdc15-2 (Figure 2D), respectively.  For example, whereas cdc15-2 and net1-6Cdk mutants were viable at 30.7°C, cdc15-2 net1-6Cdk double mutants were not.  Taken together, these observations implicate net1-6Cdk as a FEAR mutant.
Recent work has implicated the FEAR network in proper segregation of rDNA and cell cycle progression during meiosis (Buonomo et al., 2003; Lee and Amon, 2003; Marston et al., 2003).  Given that net1-6Cdk mutants exhibited phenotypes reminiscent of FEAR network mutants, we evaluated their ability to segregate rDNA and form meiotic spores.  In parallel with the 10’ delay in Cdc14 release from the nucleolus, spo12∆ and net1-6Cdk mutants exhibited a 10’ delay in rDNA segregation during mitosis (Figure 8). Likewise, net1-6Cdk mutants exhibited a meiotic defect: whereas greater than 90% of nitrogen-starved wild-type cells produced tri- or tetranucleate asci, net1-6Cdk mutants produced 43% binucleate and 57% tri- or tetranucleate asci with the majority of those being tri-nucleate (data not shown).  The meiotic defect of net1-6Cdk mutants is less severe than seen for spo12 ∆ , but closely resembles that previously reported for slk19 ∆ mutants undergoing meiosis (Buonomo et al., 2003).
Mitotic cyclin-Cdk phosphorylates sites on Net1 required for FEAR.Page 38

Given the striking phenotypes of net1-3Cdk and net1-6Cdk cells, we prepared phospho-specific antibodies using phosphorylated peptides corresponding to the three in vivo phosphorylation sites that were mutated in net1-3Cdk (designated PP-A, PP-B, and PP-C).  All three antibodies reacted with Net1 isolated from arrested cdc14-1 cells (when Net1 is maximally phosphorylated) but not with Net1-3Cdk (Figure 3A).  Moreover, the antibodies failed to detect Net1 from  α  factor-arrested cells (when Net1 is not detectably phospho-shifted) (Figure 3B).  In many of the subsequent experiments we chose to focus on the PP-B epitope (which is formed by phosphorylation on Threonine 212) because it yielded a better signal in western blot analyses.
In vitro protein kinase assays provided the first concrete evidence that Net1 is a specific Cdk substrate.  Recombinant Clb2–Cdk both generated the PP-B and PP-C epitopes on (Figure 3C), and incorporated radiolabel from γ- 32
P-ATP into recombinant Net1 (Figure 3D).  Remarkably, phosphorylation of Net1 by Clb2–Cdk was exquisitely specific, in that an equivalent amount of Clb5–Cdk histone H1 kinase activity did not phosphorylate Net1 (Figure 3D).
If Clb2-Cdk is indeed a physiological Net1 kinase, then Net1 phosphorylation should be diminished and/or delayed in a clb2∆ mutant.  Indeed, in clb2∆ cells released from a G1 cell cycle block, the timing of appearance of the PP-B antigen was delayed by approximately 30-minutes as compared to wild-type cells, but the accumulation of Clb3 was not significantly affected (Figure 4A).  We speculated that in the absence of Clb2, Clb1 compensated to phosphorylate Threonine 212 and promote FEAR, but both processes were delayed.  To test this prediction, Threonine 212 phosphorylation was evaluated in a clb1∆ mutant and in a clb1∆clb2∆ mutant kept alive by a glucose-Page 39

repressible GAL1p-CLB2 construct.  Whereas the timing and level of PP-B epitope formation were normal in clb1 ∆  cells (data not shown), clb1 ∆ clb2 ∆  GAL1p-CLB2 cells depleted of the majority of Clb2 by growth on glucose after centrifugal elutriation, proceeded from G1 phase through anaphase but arrested in late anaphase/telophase without undergoing either detectable phosphorylation on Threonine 212 (Figure 4B) or release of Cdc14 from the nucleolus (Figures 4B, 4C, 4D).  This observation was further corroborated by using an analog-sensitive version of the yeast Cdk (cdc28-as1) (Bishop et al., 2000; Ubersax et al., 2003) to demonstrate that phosphorylation of Net1 on Threonine 212 was dependent on Cdk activity as cells exited mitosis (Figure 9).
Moreover, CLB2 fulfilled the criteria established for FEAR network genes in that clb2∆ cdc15-2 cells failed to exhibit FEAR (Figures 4C and 4D), and clb2∆ enhanced the ts phenotype of cdc15-2 (Figure 4F) and dbf2-2 mutants (data not shown).  Interestingly, Cdc14 localization in both clb1∆clb2∆ and clb2∆ cdc15-2 cells appeared to remain nucleolar despite arresting in late anaphase (Figure 4C, 2 nd
 panel).  Moreover, upon meiotic segregation we could not obtain viable colonies containing clb2∆ in combination with cdc14-1, cdc5-1, or msd2-1 (data not shown) (Yuste-Rojas and Cross, 2000).
Importantly, the synthetic phenotype of clb2 ∆  MEN ts double mutants arose from an exacerbation of the MEN defect because the terminal phenotype of cdc15-2 clb2∆ remained a late anaphase arrest (Figure 4C, data not shown), even though the double mutant cells exhibited a 30-minute delay at metaphase, as expected for a clb2∆ mutant (Figures 4C, 4E).Page 40

Over-expression of non-degradable Clb2 is sufficient to drive Cdc14 out of the nucleolus in metaphase-arrested cells.
Our results with cis mutations in sites of Net1 in vivo phosphorylation coupled with trans mutations in CLB1 and CLB2 provide strong evidence that phosphorylation of Net1 on a set of N-terminal CDK sites by Clb1/Clb2-Cdk is necessary for FEAR.  Over- expression of a stable form of Clb2 (GAL1p-CLB2∆db) has been reported to arrest cells in late anaphase with Cdc14 released from the nucleolus at the onset of anaphase (Stegmeier et al., 2002; Surana et al., 1993).  To determine if regulation of Clb2-Cdk activity might normally govern the timing of FEAR, we tested whether elevated levels of Clb2 are sufficient to bring about ectopic release of Cdc14 from the nucleolus in cells arrested in metaphase. Whereas endogenous levels of Clb2 did not sustain Threonine 212 phosphorylation in metaphase-arrested cells (Figure 5A, Lane 1), over-expression of a hyper-stable form of Clb2 (CLB2C 2 DK 100 ) (Hendrickson et al., 2001) was sufficient to
drive Net1 phosphorylation and release of Cdc14 into the nucleus (Figures 5A, 5B).  By contrast, induction of stable Clb2 in cells arrested in G1 phase with alpha factor did not bring about formation of the PP-B epitope on Net1 or disrupt association of Cdc14 with Net1 (data not shown).
The ability of over-expressed Clb2 to induce premature Net1 phosphorylation and release of Cdc14 from the nucleolus prompted us to test whether Clb2–Cdk activity is sufficient to bring about disassembly of RENT in vitro.  Pre-phosphorylation of a 600 amino acid N-terminal fragment of Net1 blocked its binding to Cdc14 (Figure 5C).  The 6 Cdk consensus sites contained within the N-terminal region of Net1 were required for efficient disruption of the assembled RENT complex in vitro in that complexes isolated fromPage 41

strains expressing wild-type Net1 were dismantled by Clb2–Cdk in a dose-dependent manner, whereas complexes isolated from net1-6Cdk cells were not (Figure 5D).  Taken together, the in vivo and in vitro data indicate that Cdk phosphorylation sites on Net1 can drive RENT disassembly.
Slk19, Spo12, and Cdc5 modulate phosphorylation of Net1 on Threonine 212. Analysis of Threonine 212 phosphorylation in synchronized cells revealed an unexpected result: appearance of Clb2 antigen preceded appearance of PP-B epitope by 10-20 min (Figure 3B).  Because Clb2-associated protein kinase activity rises in parallel with Clb2 antigen (Stegmeier et al., 2002), we concluded that the ability of Clb2–Cdk to promote accumulation of phosphorylated Net1 must somehow be regulated.  Moreover, because FEAR requires both the FEAR network genes and phosphorylation of Net1 by Clb1 or Clb2–Cdk complexes, and because ectopic induction of FEAR with GAL1p- ESP1 induces Net1 hyperphosphorylation (Sullivan and Uhlmann, 2003), we
hypothesized that the FEAR network acts, at least in part, through induction of Net1 phosphorylation by Clb2–Cdk.  To test this hypothesis, we examined the Threonine 212 phosphoepitope in synchronized wild-type, slk19 ∆  and spo12 ∆  strains.  The timing of phosphorylation was delayed in both mutants for at least 10-minutes, and there was a noticeable increase in duration of the phosphoepitope in the slk19 ∆  strain (Figure 6A). To distinguish the effects of the FEAR network and MEN on Cdc14, FEAR is typically monitored in a cdc15-2 background (Stegmeier et al., 2002).  Thus, we examined the kinetics of phosphorylation of Threonine 212 in spo12∆ cdc15-2 and slk19∆ cdc15-2 cells released from an  α  factor block.  Both phosphorylation of Net1 on Threonine 212Page 42

(Figure 6B) and FEAR (Figure 6C) were greatly diminished in the double mutant cells compared to wild-type and cdc15-2 cells.
We have previously reported that Cdc5 influences the phosphorylation state of Net1 and promotes the release of Cdc14 in vivo (Shou et al., 2002a).  This regulation appears to operate at least in part through Clb-Cdk, because phosphorylation of
Threonine 212 was absent in cdc14-1 cdc5-1 double mutant cells (Figure 6D) and over- expression of stable Cdc5 promoted phosphorylation of Threonine 212 in nocodazole- arrested cells (Figure 6E). Thus, Cdc5, like Spo12 and Slk19, promotes the
phosphorylation of Net1, at least in part, through Clb-Cdk.
Discussion
Phosphorylation of Net1 by Clb-Cdk underlies FEAR
Protein phosphatase Cdc14 plays a critical role in promoting exit from the M- phase state during both mitotic and meiotic cell cycles (Buonomo et al., 2003; Jaspersen et al., 1998; Marston et al., 2003).  Cdc14 is kept under negative control during most of the cell cycle by binding to its nucleolar partner Net1, but is released from Net1 during anaphase through the actions of the FEAR and mitotic exit (MEN) networks (Shou et al., 1999; Stegmeier et al., 2002; Visintin et al., 1999).  Because the transient release of Cdc14 from Net1 during anaphase is a signature event that drives exit from M-phase, we sought to investigate how this association is regulated in the context of the more well defined pathway for mitotic exit.
Net1 is a phosphoprotein whose phosphorylation correlates inversely with the activity of Cdc14 (Shou et al., 1999; Visintin et al., 2003).  Mapping and mutation of inPage 43

vivo phosphorylation sites on Net1 (isolated from cdc14ts cells) revealed that a set of Cdk sites in the N-terminal portion of Net1 were required for the proper release of Cdc14 in early anaphase (FEAR).  Phosphorylation of these Cdk sites in Net1 was catalyzed by Cdk complexes formed by the late mitotic cyclins Clb1 and Clb2, in that they were completely absent in clb1 ∆  clb2 ∆  and cdc28-as1 mutants and that Clb2–Cdk was
sufficient to bring about phosphorylation of Net1 and disassembly of the RENT complex both in vivo and in vitro.  Interestingly, a proteomic screen by Morgan and colleagues revealed that Net1 is one of the best substrates for Clb2-Cdk in vitro (Ubersax et al., 2003).  In accordance with the observation that the FEAR network is important for proper progression through meiosis, the FEAR-deficient net1-6Cdk mutant also displayed a sporulation defect reminiscent of the slk19∆ FEAR mutant.  Net1 phosphorylation by Clb-Cdk is likely to be a recurrent theme of M-phase progression in budding yeasts, because the majority of the N-terminal Cdk phosphorylation sites in Net1 are highly conserved among orthologs found in other fungal species (Figure 10).  A similar phosphorylation-based mechanism may likewise control the transient association of human Cdc14A with the nucleolus (Mailand et al., 2002).
FEAR network promotes phosphorylation of Net1 by Clb1,2-Cdk
Release of Cdc14 from Net1 during early anaphase requires the FEAR network components Spo12, Slk19, Cdc5, and Esp1 in addition to phosphorylation of Net1 by Clb1,2-Cdk.  Since the phosphorylation of Net1 by Clb-Cdk lagged behind the
accumulation of Clb2, we sought to test whether the FEAR network acts by switching on the phosphorylation of Net1 by pre-formed Clb-Cdk.  Whereas phosphorylation of Net1Page 44

was only moderately delayed in both spo12∆ and slk19∆ mutants, it was severely impaired in cdc5-1 mutants.  We propose that either the FEAR network or the MEN can dissociate Cdc14 from Net1, and they act by independent mechanisms.  FEAR network brings about RENT complex disassembly by promoting the phosphorylation of Net1 by Clb-Cdk.  In contrast, the mild phenotype of the net1-6Cdk mutant indicates that the MEN can bring about release of Cdc14 from Net1 even in the absence of these same phosphorylations.  Nevertheless, the MEN promotes phosphorylation of Net1 by Clb- Cdk, but possibly as an indirect consequence of exposing phosphorylation sites on Net1 that are normally shielded by bound Cdc14.  Thus, whereas Net1 phosphorylation by Clb-Cdk is required for FEAR, we propose the same phosphorylations can occur as a passive consequence of Cdc14 release that is triggered by the MEN via a distinct mechanism.  Consistent with this interpretation, in the absence of both the FEAR and mitotic exit networks (spo12∆ cdc15-2, slk19∆ cdc15-2, and cdc5-1 mutants), Net1 phosphorylation on Cdk sites was drastically reduced.  It remains unknown how the FEAR network promotes phosphorylation of Net1 by Clb-Cdk.  The putative ‘effector’ components of the FEAR network, Cdc5 and Spo12 (Sullivan and Uhlmann, 2003; Visintin et al., 2003), may modulate Net1, Clb-Cdk, or a Net1 phosphatase to promote accumulation of phosphate groups on Net1.
Is Net1 phosphorylation by Clb–Cdk sufficient for FEAR?
Our data indicate that FEAR components Spo12, Slk19, and Cdc5 act, at least in part, through phosphorylation of Net1 by Clb–Cdk to promote disassembly of the RENT complex.  This raises two important, related questions: is activation of Net1Page 45

phosphorylation the only function of the FEAR, and is phosphorylation of Net1 on Cdk sites sufficient to dislodge Cdc14? Mutant spo12 ∆  cells have a sporulation defect that is more severe than that of net1-6Cdk mutants, suggestive of additional roles for Spo12 that go beyond phosphorylation of Net1.  Moreover, the early anaphase release of Cdc14 promoted by the FEAR network in a cdc15-2 mutant is transient (Stegmeier et al., 2002), whereas the phosphorylation of Net1 on Threonine 212 is not (Figure 6).   Thus, although the FEAR network promotes phosphorylation of Net1 and dissociation of Cdc14 from Net1, the former does not appear to be sufficient for the latter.  On the other hand, Clb2–Cdk was sufficient to dislodge Cdc14 from Net1 in vitro, and over-expression of Clb2 brought about release of Cdc14 from Net1 in nocodazole-arrested cells (in which the FEAR network is inactive due to inhibition of Esp1 by securin).  One possible explanation is that the FEAR network mobilizes Clb–Cdk to promote stable
phosphorylation of Net1 and labile phosphorylation of a second target (possibly Cdc14?), and that both of these phosphorylations are needed to sustain release of Cdc14 from Net1 in vivo.  Attempts to resolve this issue through expression of NET1 mutants bearing phosphomimetic substitutions have been thwarted by the apparent hypomorphic nature of these alleles (data not shown).
Regardless of whether phosphorylation of Net1 by Clb2–Cdk is sufficient to dismantle RENT in vivo, there clearly is yet another mysterious dimension to this
regulatory mechanism, in that Clb2 over-expressed in G1 phase promoted neither release of Cdc14 from Net1 nor phosphorylation of Net1.  Thus, there appears to be at least one cell cycle-regulated factor in addition to the FEAR network that controls the ability of Clb2–Cdk to promote accumulation of phosphate on Net1.  Despite these unsolvedPage 46

issues, it is clear that phosphorylation of Net1 by Clb–Cdk is a key mechanism by which the FEAR network instigates disassembly of the RENT complex during mitosis.
On the roles of Cdc5 and Clb-Cdk protein kinase activities in FEAR
In previous work, we reported that Cdc5 influences the phosphorylation of Net1 and disassembly of the RENT complex (Shou et al., 2002a).  Our current observations that Cdc5 is necessary and sufficient for phosphorylation of Net1 by Clb–Cdk lead us to propose that Cdc5 controls Net1 phosphorylation primarily through Clb–Cdk.  However, to evaluate the relative role of Cdc5 in more detail requires careful consideration of our prior findings.  To address the role of Cdc5 in RENT disassembly in vivo, we originally constructed a mutant Net1 (net1-7m) lacking the 7 sites of in vitro phosphorylation that contributed most prominently to the Cdc5-induced dissociation of recombinant
Cdc14–Net1 complexes (Shou et al, 2002).  Mutant net1-7m cells exhibited both the FEAR and MEN components of Cdc14 release from the nucleus during mitosis, but the former was diminished by approximately 25%.  Although this result could arise directly from failure of Cdc5 to phosphorylate Net1, it could also be an indirect consequence of mutating multiple sites in Net1, given that none of the sites mutated in net1-7m were found in this study to be phosphorylated in vivo.  Interestingly, of the 17 sites on Net1 that were definitively identified as being phosphorylated by Cdc5 in vitro (Loughrey Chen et al., 2002), only two (S231 and S259) were confirmed here to be modified in vivo. A mutant lacking S169, S231 and S259 (net1-3Ax) (the non-Cdk sites mutated in net1- 6m) displayed an extremely modest (~20%) defect in FEAR (Figure 7C).  Thus, Cdc5 may promote FEAR both by enabling the action of Clb-Cdk, and by directPage 47

phosphorylation of Net1.  However, our cis mutant analysis of Net1 clearly indicates that the former role is critical, and the latter role is, at best, minor.  We wish to note that the putative Cdc5 phosphorylation sites (S231 and S259) do not lie in the recently reported consensus for Cdc5/Polo kinases (Nakajima et al, 2003), and thus it remains possible that these sites may normally be phosphorylated by an unknown protein kinase in vivo, and Cdc5 may act solely through Clb–Cdk.
Although the action of the FEAR network is not essential for mitotic cell cycles, its activity helps to determine the timing of exit from mitosis (Stegmeier et al., 2002).  Our finding that phosphorylation of Net1 by Clb-Cdk underlies disruption of the RENT complex during anaphase illustrates a fascinating aspect of the switch that governs the return of mitotic cells to an interphase state.  Although Clb-Cdk initiates feedback loops that help sustain a mitotic state with high Clb-Cdk activity (Deshaies, 1997), there must be mechanisms for subverting the reign of Clb-Cdk to allow growing cells to continue to cycle.  Fittingly, at least two of these mechanisms – activation of Cdc20 binding to APC (Rudner et al., 2000; Rudner and Murray, 2000) and disruption of the Cdc14/Net1 complex – are initiated directly by the very enzyme whose activity helps to specify the mitotic state in the first place.  Given that clb1∆ clb2∆ mutants display an anaphase defect far more severe than net1-6Cdk indicates that other aspects of this crucial switch await discovery.Page 48

Experimental Procedures
Strain construction, materials, and Net1 mutagenesis
All strains used are in the W303 background (can1-100, leu2-3, his3-11, trp1-1, ura3-1, ade2-1) except where noted in the strain table (Supplementary Table 1).  A strain expressing a stable form of Clb2 lacking both the KEN and destruction boxes
(Clb2C 2 DK 100 )HA3 was used in over-expression experiments with Clb2 (Hendrickson et
al., 2001).
Net1 mutant constructs were created as previously described (Shou et al., 2002a). Briefly, a wild-type NET1-myc9 epitope tagged construct was cloned into a modified pRS304 vector containing 300bp upstream of the ATG translation start site using NcoI and EagI.  Site-directed mutagenesis of Serine/Threonine to Alanine was carried outPage 49

using QuikChange Site-Directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA).  The indicated Serine/Threonine were mutated to Alanine in Net1-13m
(166,169,212,231,252,259,356,362,384,385,497,611,676), Net1-6m
(166,169,212,231,252,259), Net1-3-Cdk (166,212,252), and Net1-6Cdk (62*,
166,212,252,297,304) where * indicates that residue 62 was mutated to ensure complete elimination of all Cdk consensus sites even though it was not determined to be
phosphorylated in vivo.  Mutagenesis was confirmed using restriction digests followed by DNA sequencing.  All constructs were targeted by linearization with BstXI to the trp1 locus in a NET1/net1::his5 +  heterozygous diploid.  The strains were sporulated and tetrads were dissected to obtain a haploid isolate of the integrant over net1::his5 +
.  Copy number of integrants was estimated by normalizing extract protein from transformed and wild-type cells and blotting for Net1 levels.  Proper localization of all net1 phosphosite mutants was confirmed by indirect immuno-fluorescence against the myc epitope (data not shown).
Production and purification of antibodies made against phosphorylated peptides were performed by Abgent (San Diego, CA).  A pair of peptides – phosphorylated or not at the indicated, underlined residue – was synthesized to generate and purify each of the following antibodies against Net1: anti-phosphopeptide A corresponding to aa 159-173 (RSKLNNGSPQSVQPQC); anti-phosphopeptide B corresponding to aa 205-219 (NGSMRVWTPLARQIYC); and anti-phosphopeptide C corresponding to aa 245-259 (PPPTQPQSPPIRISSC).  All peptides contained a Cysteine at the C-terminus, and anti- phosphopeptide B was modified by replacing Serine with Tryptophan at the –1 position relative to the underlined Threonine to optimize the phosphoepitope presentation.Page 50

Antibodies specifically reactive against the phosphopeptides were positively selected on a resin derivatized with the phosphopeptide immunogen and negatively selected by passage through a resin derivatized with the unphosphorylated version of the peptide. Anti-phosphopeptide B ( α -PP-B) was used in all experiments described since it generated the strongest signal against Phospho-Net1 (Figure 3A).
Cell Growth and Synchronization Procedures
Cells were grown in yeast extract-peptone (YP) or in yeast minimal (YM) media containing 2% glucose (YPD,YMD), 2% raffinose (YPR,YMR) or 2% galactose
(YPG,YMG) as carbon source.  Where appropriate, minimal media were supplemented with leucine, histidine, tryptophan, uracil, and adenine to complement auxotrophies. Synchronization of cells in G1 phase was achieved with α-factor added at 10 µg/ml for BAR1 cells and 0.1 µg/ml for bar1 ∆  cells for at least 3 hrs at 25 ° C.  Cells were judged to be arrested when greater than 90% of cells displayed the elongated &#34;shmoo&#34; phenotype. Cells were released from  α  factor by filtration through a 0.2  µ m filter followed by a wash with 150 ml of YP, then resuspended in the desired volume at a density of 1 O.D. 600 /ml.
For elutriation, cells were grown overnight in YP containing 2% raffinose and 2% galactose and harvested at log phase.  Elutriation was performed as described (Amon, 2002; Johnston and Johnson, 1997; Walker, 1999) for the collection of small, unbudded G1 cells; contamination with budded cells was measured to be no more than 2%.  For galactose induction experiments, cells were grown overnight in either YMR or YPR until an O.D. 600  of 1.0 was reached, then induced with 2% galactose followed by time point
collection.Page 51

Cell Extract Preparation and Western Blotting
Cells were grown to an O.D. 600  of 1.0, and for every time point 2 ml of culture
was collected and TCA added to a final concentration of 20%.  Cells were collected by centrifugation and washed with 2 ml of Tris-HCl (pH 7.5).  SDS loading buffer [70 µl of 100mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 20% glycerol, 4% SDS, 2M Urea, 200mM DTT] was added, tubes were boiled for 3-minutes, and 100  µ l of acid-washed glass beads (500  µ m) were added to each tube followed by boiling for an additional 2-minutes.  Tubes were vortexed for 45 sec using a Bio 101 multi-bead vortexer at setting 5.5.  Tubes were boiled again for 2-minutes and 5 µl of sample was fractionated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel followed by transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane.  Western blot analysis was performed with the following primary antibodies at the indicated dilutions: All anti-phospho Net1 antibodies ( α -PP-A,  α -PP-B,  α -PP-C) at 2  µ g/ml; anti-Clb2 (1:3000), anti-Cdc28 (1:5000), anti- Clb3 (1:2000), anti-myc (9E10) (1:5000), anti-His (1:250), anti-HA (1:5000), and anti- Cdc14 (1:1000).
Immunoprecipitation and Clb2–Cdk release/kinase assay.
To prepare extracts for immunoprecipitation, 10 O.D. 600  units of a log phase cell
culture was harvested and washed with 2 ml of Tris-HCl (pH 7.5).  Cells were re- suspended in 500  µ l lysis buffer [25 mM HEPES/KOH (pH7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.2% Triton, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM Benzamidine, 1x Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Aprotinin, Chymostatin, Leupeptin, and PepstatinA all at 5  µ g/ml in 90% DMSO)], transferred to a flat-bottom 2 ml tube and supplemented with 100µl ofPage 52

acid-washed glass beads (500 µm).  Samples were vortexed using a Bio 101 multi- beads vortexer at setting 5.5 (speed) and 45sec (time).  Tubes were then centrifuged for 5-minutes at 14,000 rpm and the supernatant was collected.  Clarified extract (400  µ l) was incubated with 60  µ l of 9E10-coupled protein A beads for 1 hour on a rotator at 4 ° C. Beads were collected and washed ten times in wash buffer [25 mM HEPES/KOH
(pH7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.2% Triton], and divided to approximately 15  µ l beads per reaction condition.  For protein kinase assays, 3 µl of either Clb2–Cdk or Clb5–Cdk was used with either 1  µ g of myc9-Net1 (purified from insect cells infected with a recombinant baculovirus) (Shou et al., 2001), or 5  µ g of Histone H1.  For assays that monitored release of Cdc14 from bead-bound Net1-myc9, varying concentrations of in vitro assembled Clb2–Cdk in 30µl kinase buffer [25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM ATP, 1 mM DTT, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 50 mM NaCl] were mixed with 15  µ l
9E10 beads coated with RENT complex. Reactions were allowed to proceed for 30- minutes on a rotator at 25 ° C.  Supernatant and beads were processed for Western blot analysis as previously described (Shou et al., 2002a).  For in vitro assays with bacterially expressed constructs, approximately 116 ng of Net1 per 20  µ l of Ni +2
-NTA beads, 10 ng Cdc14, and 5  µ l of roughly 30 ng/ µ l stock of Clb2–Cdk was used per reaction.
Immuno-fluorescence and Cdc14 release quantification
Immuno-fluorescence was performed as previously described (Shou et al., 2002a; Shou et al., 1999).  The analysis of Cdc14 localization for (Figure 1) was performed in haploid cells carrying the transposon-mutagenized net1 allele.  Rabbit anti-Cdc14 (1/3000) and rat anti-tubulin monoclonal antibody YL1/34 (1/1000) were used at thePage 53

indicated dilutions.  Images of synchronized cells at 70 to 110 minutes following
release from  α  factor were collected on a Zeiss Axioskop or Axiovert 200M microscope using a Hamamatsu CCD digital camera.  Spindle length measurements were performed using Zeiss Axiovision software.

Figure II-1:  Cell cycle-regulated binding site for Cdc14 resides in the N-terminal half of Net1
Transposon insertion and truncation mutants of Net1 define a cell cycle-regulated Cdc14–binding domain.  The numbers adjacent to each construct indicate where the transposon insertion occurred in the NET1 locus with the exception of the aa 1-621 HA- fragment of Net1 in which endogenous NET1 was replaced by the truncated allele (RJD1783).  The localization of Cdc14 and the length of microtubule spindles in asynchronous cell populations were determined by indirect immuno-fluorescence using anti-Cdc14 and anti-tubulin antibodies, respectively.  Cell cycle position was estimated from the length of the microtubule spindle.  The hatched bars indicate fragments of Net1 with proper nucleolar localization as reported in the TRIPLES database (Ross-Macdonald et al., 1999).  ‘N+C’ refers to both nuclear and cytoplasmic staining.Page 65

Figure II-2: Net1 phosphorylation site mutants display Cdc14 release defects and synthetic interactions with MEN mutants.
(A) Net1 mutants are defective in Cdc14 release in early anaphase.  Mutant cdc15-2 cells carrying either NET1 (WT) (RJD2617), net1-3Cdk (3Cdk) (RJD2613), or net1-6Cdk (6Cdk) (RJD2614) alleles were synchronized with α factor at 25°C and released in YP 2% glucose at 37 ° C.  Cells were collected at 10 to15 minute time intervals for analysis by indirect immuno-fluorescence.  Staining was performed with DAPI, anti-Cdc14 and anti- tubulin antibodies for determination of nuclear position, Cdc14 localization, and
microtubule spindle length, respectively.  Cell outlines are indicated for comparison.
(B) Quantitation of Fourteen Early Anaphase Release (FEAR) defect of Net1
phosphorylation site mutants.  Synchronized cells collected at 70 to110 minutes after release from  α  factor were double-labeled with anti-Cdc14 and anti-tubulin antibodies. Spindle length was measured and localization of Cdc14 was determined to be either: 1, full release (black boxes; complete release of Cdc14 from the nucleolus into the nucleus); or 2, partial release (white boxes; Cdc14 was nuclear in one of the DAPI masses and nucleolar in the other DAPI mass in the same cell, or Cdc14 was not completely restricted to the nucleolus in either DAPI mass).  Over 350 cells were counted for each panel.
(C) Mutant net1-3Cdk enhances the temperature-sensitive growth phenotype of dbf2-2. Starting with 3000 cells, 3-fold serial dilutions of dbf2-2 (RJD2625) and dbf2-2 carrying a net1-3Cdk allele (RJD2626) were spotted on YPD plates from right to left, andPage 67

incubated at the indicated temperature for 2-3 days before the picture was taken.  Two independent isolates of each strain were used.  The first two isolates in the 33.5 ° C panel were compiled from different sections of the same plate.
(D) Mutant net1-6Cdk exacerbates the temperature-sensitive growth phenotype of cdc15- 2.  Starting with 3000 cells, 3-fold serial dilutions of cdc15-2 (RJD2610) and cdc15-2 carrying a net1-6Cdk allele (RJD2614) were spotted on YPD plates as described for panel (C).Page 68

Figure II-3:  Net1 phosphorylation by Clb2–Cdk is cell cycle regulated and sufficient for disruption of Cdc14 binding in vitro.
(A) Phospho-specific antibodies to Net1.  Three phospho-specific antibodies were raised against peptides containing either phosphorylated Serine166 ( α -PP-A), Threonine 212 (α-PP-B), or Serine 252 (α-PP-C).  Crude extracts from cdc14-1 strains carrying either a wild-type (+) (RJD2615) or a mutant (3Cdk) NET1-myc9 allele (RJD2616) in which the three sites were converted to Alanine were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and
immunoblotted with the different antibodies to evaluate specificity.  Anti-myc (9E10) detection of Net1-myc9 was used as a loading control.
(B) Net1 phosphorylation on Threonine 212 is cell cycle regulated.  Cells arrested in α
factor were released from G1 block and samples were collected at the indicated time points (min).  Phosphoepitope formation, Net1-myc9, and Clb2 levels were monitored by fractionating crude cell extracts by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with  α -PP-B,  α -myc (9E10), and  α -Clb2 antibodies, respectively.  Cdc28 levels ( α -Cdc28) were used as a loading control.
(C) Clb2–Cdk generates the in vivo phosphoepitopes in vitro.  Net1-myc9 was
immunoprecipitated from  α  factor-arrested cells and the bead-bound protein was treated with protein kinase Clb2–Cdk in the presence (+) or absence (-) of ATP.  The bead-bound material was fractionated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with  α -PP-B and  α -PP-CPage 70

antibodies to monitor formation of the phosphoepitopes on Net1.  Anti-myc (9E10) detection of Net1-myc9 was used as a loading control.
(D) Net1 is a substrate for Clb2–Cdk in vitro.  Clb2–Cdk and Clb5–Cdk protein kinase complexes were incubated in vitro with Net1 and radiolabeled  32
P (top panel).  The amounts of each kinase complex used for this experiment were matched using histone H1 as a substrate (bottom panel).Page 71

Figure II-4:  Clb1 and Clb2 control the timing and appearance of the phosphoepitope on Net1.
(A) Mutant clb2∆ cells have a prolonged delay in phosphoepitope formation.  Isogenic wild-type (RJD2617) and clb2 ∆  (RJD2623) strains were synchronized in  α  factor and released.  Samples were collected at 10-minute intervals, analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies.  Alpha factor was added back after 70- minutes to prevent cells from entering into a second cell cycle.  Phosphoepitope
formation was monitored by  α -PP-B.  Appearance of Clb3 antigen ( α -Clb3) was used as a marker for cell cycle progression.  Cdc28 levels (α-Cdc28) were used as a loading control.
(B) Phosphoepitope formation on Net1 is abolished in clb1∆ clb2∆ cells.  Wild-type or clb1 ∆  clb2 ∆  GAL1p-CLB2 (clb1 ∆ , clb2 ∆ ) (RJD2624) cells were grown overnight in YP 2% raffinose plus 2% galactose and harvested for elutriation.  Elutriation was performed as described (Johnston and Johnson, 1997; Walker, 1999).  Elutriated G1 phase cells were inoculated into YP 2% glucose.  Alpha factor was added to wild-type cells after 180-minutes in YP 2% glucose.  Alpha factor was also added to clb1 ∆ , clb2 ∆  cells after 300-minutes in YP 2% glucose to prevent them from initiating a second cell cycle.  At each indicated time point, cells were collected for Western blot analysis.
Phosphoepitope formation and levels of Clb2 were monitored by  α -PP-B and  α - Clb2, respectively.  Cdc28 levels ( α -Cdc28) were used as a loading control.  Cells were also subjected to indirect immuno-fluorescence with anti-Cdc14 and anti-tubulin
antibodies as previously described.Page 75

(C) Impaired release of Cdc14 in early anaphase in clb1 ∆  clb2 ∆  and cdc15-2 clb2 ∆ mutants.  Samples of clb1∆ clb2∆ GAL1p-CLB2 and cdc15-2 clb2∆ cells (RJD 2622) were collected after elutriation/GAL-shutoff or  α  factor block/release, respectively, for analysis by indirect immuno-fluorescence with DAPI, anti-Cdc14, and anti-tubulin antibodies.  Two panels are shown for each mutant cell line, representing early anaphase (1 st
 panel) and late anaphase (2 nd
 panel). Cell outlines are indicated for comparison.
(D) Fourteen Early Anaphase Release (FEAR) defect of clb1 ∆  clb2 ∆  and cdc15-2 clb2 ∆ cells.  Cells were collected after elutriation and GAL shutoff (clb1∆ clb2∆ GAL1p-CLB2) or  α  factor release (clb2∆ cdc15-2) and double-labeled with anti-Cdc14 and anti-tubulin antibodies.  Spindle length was measured and release of Cdc14 from the nucleolus was determined to be either complete (black boxes) or partial (white boxes; see legend to Fig. 2B).  Over 350 cells were counted for each panel.
(E) Mutant cdc15-2 clb2 ∆  cells arrest in late anaphase.  Mutant cdc15-2 cells (open squares) (RJD2630), cdc15-2 clb2∆ cells (closed diamonds) (RJD2631), and esp1-1 cells (open circles) (RJD2629) containing a tetO112 array at the URA3 locus and expressing 3tetR-GFP from the HIS3 locus were synchronized in G1 phase with  α  factor and
released into YP 2% glucose at 37 ° C.  Samples were taken at the indicated time points to determine the percentage of cells with unsegregated chromosomes (one GFP dot)
compared to cells that have segregated their chromosomes (two GFP dots).Page 76

(F) Mutant clb2∆ exacerbates the temperature-sensitive growth phenotype of Mitotic Exit Network (MEN) mutants.  Starting with 3000 cells, 3-fold serial dilutions of cdc15-2 (RJD602) and cdc15-2 clb2∆ cells (RJD2622) were spotted on YPD plates as described in the legend of Fig. 2C.  Three independent isolates of each strain were used.Page 77

Figure II-5:  Over-expression of Clb2 is sufficient to drive Cdc14 out of the nucleolus in cells arrested in mitosis with microtubule poisons. (A) Over-expression of a stable form of Clb2 promotes Net1 phosphorylation on Threonine 212.  NET1-myc9 cells carrying a galactose-inducible cassette that encodes a stabilized form of Clb2 that lacks both the destruction and KEN boxes (GAL1p-
CLB2C 2 DK 100 ) (RJD2627) were arrested with 30 µ g/ml benomyl plus 15 µ g/ml
nocodazole at 23°C for 3 hours in YP 2% raffinose.  At various times after galactose was
added to induce expression of Clb2C 2 DK 100 , samples were withdrawn, fractionated by
SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with α-PP-B, α-Clb2, and α-Cdc28 as previously described.
(B) Over-expression of a stable form of Clb2 promotes release of Cdc14 from the nucleolus in cells arrested in mitosis.  Cells were arrested in mitosis with benomyl and nocodazole as described for panel (A), and samples were collected at the indicated time points for indirect immuno-fluorescence.  Staining was performed using DAPI together with anti-Cdc14 and anti-tubulin antibodies as previously described. Cell outlines are indicated for comparison.
(C) Phosphorylation of Net1 (aa 1-601) by Clb2–Cdk disrupts Cdc14 binding in vitro. Proteins were expressed and purified from bacteria as described (Shou et al., 2002a). His6-T7-Net1 was captured on Ni +2 -NTA beads and either treated with Clb2–Cdk or buffer prior to addition of GST-T7-Cdc14.  After a 30-minute incubation at 25°C, the NTA beads were sedimented, washed 5 times with wash buffer, and processed for SDS-Page 79

PAGE analysis and subsequent Western blotting.  Amounts of Net1 and Cdc14 bound to NTA beads were determined by blotting with  α -His and  α -Cdc14, respectively.

Figure II-6: Net1 phosphorylation on Threonine 212 is modulated by Slk19, Spo12, and Cdc5.
(A) The dynamics of Threonine 212 phosphorylation are altered in slk19∆ and spo12∆ mutants.  Isogenic strains of wild-type (RJD2617), slk19 ∆  (RJD2618), and spo12 ∆ (RJD2619) carrying a NET1-myc9 allele were synchronized by addition of α factor. Cells were released from  α  factor block and samples were collected at the indicated time points (min).  Phosphoepitope formation, Net1-myc9, and Clb2 levels were monitored as previously described.  Please refer to (Figure 11) for loading controls.
(B) Blockade of Cdc14 early anaphase release (FEAR) is accompanied by loss of Net1 phosphorylation on Threonine 212.  Isogenic strains of (i) wild-type (RJD2617), (ii) cdc15- 2 (RJD2610), (iii) cdc15-2 spo12∆ (RJD2620), and (iv) cdc15-2 slk19∆ (RJD2621) were synchronized in  α  factor then released into pre-warmed YP 2% glucose at 36 ° C.  Aliquots of each culture were collected at the indicated time points for analysis by Western blotting. Phosphoepitope formation, Net1-myc9, and Clb2 levels were monitored as previously described.  Please refer to (Figure 11) for loading controls.
(C) Cdc15 along with either Spo12 or Slk19 is required for proper release of Cdc14 from the nucleolus during early anaphase.  The same aliquots collected for panel (B) were also analyzed by indirect immuno-fluorescence with anti-Cdc14 and anti-tubulin antibodies as previously described.Page 82

(D) Net1 phosphorylation on Threonine 212 is dependent on Cdc5.  Wild-type (+) (RJD1349), cdc5-1 (5) (RJD1417), cdc14-1 (14) (RJD1408), and cdc5-1 cdc14-1 (5,14) (RJD2628) cells carrying a NET1-myc9 epitope tagged allele were grown logarithmically at 25 ° C and samples for each culture collected.  Cultures were shifted to 37 ° C for 3 hours and samples were collected again for analysis by Western blotting.  Phosphoepitope formation, Net1-myc9 levels, Clb2, and Cdc28 levels were monitored as previously described.
(E) Over-expressed Cdc5 lacking the destruction box (DB) motif promotes Net1 phosphorylation on Threonine 212 in metaphase-arrested cells. Wild-type (RJD2634), and GAL1p-CDC5( ∆ DB) (RJD2635) cells carrying a  NET1myc9 epitope tagged allele were grown logarithmically at 26°C and arrested with 30µg/ml benomyl plus 15µg/ml
nocodazole in YP 2% raffinose.  At various times after galactose was added to induce expression, samples were withdrawn, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with  α -PP-B,  α -Clb2, and  α -Cdc28 as previously described.  Levels of Cdc5 ∆ db induction were determined by blotting for  α -HA.Page 83

Figure II-7:  Net1 mutants are defective in Cdc14 release in early anaphase.
(A) Mutant cdc15-2 cells carrying either net1-13m (RJD2611) or net1-6m (RJD2612) alleles were synchronized with  α  factor at 25 ° C and released in YP 2% glucose at 37 ° C. Cells were collected for analysis by indirect immuno-fluorescence at 10 to15 minute time intervals.  Staining was performed with DAPI, anti-Cdc14, and anti-tubulin antibodies for determination of nuclear position, Cdc14 localization, and spindle length, respectively. Cell outlines are indicated for comparison.
(B) Mutant cdc15-2 cells carrying either net1-13m, or net1-6m alleles were synchronized with  α  factor 25 ° C and released in YP 2% glucose at 37°C.  Cells collected at 70 to110 minutes after α factor release were double-labeled with anti-Cdc14 and anti-tubulin antibodies.  Release of Cdc14 from the nucleolus was determined to be either complete (black boxes) or partial (white boxes; see legend to Fig. 2B) and was plotted against spindle length.  Over 350 cells were counted for each panel.  The wild-type NET1 control is shown in Figure 2B.
(C) Mutant cdc15-2 cells carrying net1-3Ax (an allele where the 3 non-Cdk sites S169, S231, and S259 from the net1-6m were mutated to Alanine) were synchronized with  α factor 25°C and released in YP 2% glucose at 37°C.  Cells collected at 70 to 110 minutes after  α  factor release were double-labeled with anti-Cdc14 and anti-tubulin antibodies. Release of Cdc14 from the nucleolus was determined to be either complete (black boxes)Page 85

Introduction
Given the ability of the RENT complex to regulate mitotic exit via controlling the release and activation of Cdc14 (Shou et al., 1999; Visintin et al., 1999), we sought to identify more components that might govern this unique interaction of a mitotic control protein with its nucleolar inhibitor Net1. The RENT complex is composed of three identified components: Net1 a nucleolar protein responsible for maintaining nucleolar integrity and regulating the activation and release of Cdc14 (the protein phosphatase responsible for reversal of Cdk phosphorylation at the end of mitosis) (Visintin et al., 1998), and Sir2 (the histone deactylase responsible for maintaining transcriptional silencing at the rDNA, mating type, and telomeric loci) (Gottschling, 2000; Shou et al., 1999; Straight et al., 1999).  The RENT was initially identified using a unique approach known as Sequential Epitope tagging/immunoAffinity chromatography/Mass
spectrometry (SEAM) (Shou et al., 1999). This new technique enabled us to identify new protein interactors that co-immunoprecipitated with tagged subunits of the RENT
complex, specifically Net1. The first interactor to be identified was RPC40, a subunit of RNA polymerase I holoenzyme which resides in the nucleolus and is responsible for ribosomal RNA transcription. The second interactor identified was a catalytic subunit of Casein Kinase II (CKII), a pleiotropic, multi-ubiquitous serine or threonine protein kinase conserved throughout eukaryotes and implicated in a diverse range of cellular processesPage 99

including ionic sensing (Glover, 1998), nuclear matrix regulation, cellular growth (Ahmed, 1999; Ahmed et al., 2000), calmodulin regulation (Benaim and Villalobo, 2002), DNA damage, transcriptional regulation (Schultz, 2003), and cell-cycle progression (Glover, 1998; Glover et al., 1994).
RNA Polymerase I (Pol I)
In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the nucleolus contains 150-180 tandem repeats of a 9.1 kilobase segment of DNA known as the rDNA on the arm of Chromosome XII (Petes and Botstein, 1977). The rDNA transcription product codes for a single 35S rRNA precursor which is post-transcriptionally processed to yield a 25S and 5.8S RNA species incorporated in the 60S ribosomal subunit and an 18S RNA species found in the 40S ribosomal subunit (Warner et al., 1973). Transcription of the ribosomal DNA repeats is carried out by RNA Polymerase I (Pol I), a holoenzyme composed of 14 proteins (Carles et al., 1991; Huet et al., 1975) and accounts for at least 60% of total cellular transcript. Pol I specificity for rDNA transcription is achieved through promoter specificity but little else in known about the sites of initiation and termination. Transcription of rDNA by Pol I has been linked to an interesting phenomenon known as gene silencing in which Pol II normally transcribed-genes are transcriptionally repressed when inserted into the rDNA tandem array (Smith and Boeke, 1997). Regulation of nucleolar silencing requires a functional RENT complex as well as a functional Pol I as demonstrated by a recent finding that silencing in addition to requiring a functional Sir2 protein also required transcription by RNA polymerase I (Buck et al., 2002; Shou et al., 2001).  The direction of spreading was surprisingly controlled by the direction of Pol I transcription (Buck etPage 100

al., 2002). An intact nucleolus is also required for maintenance of proper silencing as demonstrated by net1-1 and rDNA deletion mutants (Oakes et al., 1998; Shou et al., 2001). Thus, Pol I transcription and proper nucleolar silencing play an important role in maintaining cellular function and preventing senescence through the formation of rDNA circles as has been demonstrated for silencing mutants (Defossez et al., 1998; Gershon and Gershon, 2000; Shore, 1998).
Casein Kinase II (CKII)
Casein kinase II (CKII) is one of the most highly conserved Serine/Threonine kinases from yeast to man (Guerra and Issinger, 1999). It consists of a tetrameric holoenzyme ( α 2 β 2 ) made up of two regulatory subunits ( β 2 ) (Ckb1, Ckb2) and the more
evolutionally conserved two catalytic subunits ( α 2 ) (Cka1, Cka2). To date, more than 160
potential substrates have been identified for CKII (Pinna and Meggio, 1997) highlighting the pleiotropic, yet surprisingly essential role for CKII is cell survival. Notably,
Nucleolin, a protein found in the nucleolus of mammalian cells has proved to be one of the best substrates for CKII (Caizergues-Ferrer et al., 1987; Schneider and Issinger, 1988).   In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, CKII’s function is essential as deletion of both the α -catalytic subunits is lethal yet, again surprisingly; deletion of one or both of the
regulatory  β -subunits displays no obvious phenotype (Glover, 1998). The most obvious phenotype arises when ckb1 ∆  ckb2 ∆  mutant cells are challenged on minimal media, and any combination of cka1∆ or cka2∆ with either of the ckb1∆ or ckb2∆ display slow growth and flocculation (Glover, 1998).  Over-expression analysis of either the catalytic or regulatory subunits from Drosophila in Saccharomyces cerevisiae has had little impact
